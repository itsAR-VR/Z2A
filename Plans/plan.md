PLAN
* Lock the non‑negotiables (premium, in‑person, hands‑on, shipped outcome, pods).
* Generate short, speakable names + taglines that signal “real systems, not theory.”
* Stress‑test each option against the three personas and pilot‑cohort constraints.
LOCATE
* Source of truth: the provided context brief (pilot launch in Toronto, then expand across North America).
* Guardrails: premium, practical, outcome‑first; no hype, no job/income guarantees; no invented facts.
EXTRACT
Minimum grounding constraints (direct phrases):
* “premium”
* “2-day in-person weekend workshop”
* “hands-on keyboard”
* “pods of 3–4”
* “build … deploy … evaluation/testing workflow”
* “No alcohol”
* “Do NOT rely on paid ads for the pilot”
* “Toronto first then NA”
SOLVE
1) Parent brand name directions (what we’re optimizing for)
* Calm confidence (anti‑hype): feels safe to bring to a manager for reimbursement.
* Craft + execution: implies “build time,” not lecture time.
* Premium ops vibe: studio/workbench/toolroom language suggests organization and support.
* Expandable beyond one workshop (can hold multiple programs).
2) Program naming directions (what we’re optimizing for)
* Clear arc: start → build → deploy → test → demo.
* Time‑boxed intensity: “weekend / Sunday demo” energy without “bootcamp” language.
* Signals pods: collaborative build, supported execution.
3) Tagline directions
* Concrete verbs: build, deploy, test, demo, evaluate, ship.
* In‑person advantage: accountability + live help + peers.
* Outcome promise: “leave with a working agent,” not “learn AI.”
4) Voice rules directions
* Premium + practical: crisp, operational, organized.
* Ethical anxiety framing: “stay relevant” without fearmongering.
* Honest scope: “basic deployment approach” is explicit; avoid “productionize your company.”
5) Persona positioning directions
* [PM_ADVANCED]: shipping agentic features internally.
* [WORKING_PRO]: practical workflows + confidence via building.
* [FOUNDER]: ROI‑focused prototype + repeatable path (not bespoke consulting).
VERIFY
* Names are 1–3 words, speakable, and avoid “Academy / Bootcamp / Workshop / School” style generics.
* Includes required options: “Normal Bots” (flagged rights check), “Zero-to-Agent” (flagged working title).
* Taglines emphasize in‑person + shipped outcome; no job/income promises.
* Positioning avoids invented claims; proof points are placeholders, not credentials.
* Uncertainties are flagged: rights/trademark, currency TBD, Ramadan timing estimate, late‑May tech‑week dates to confirm.

E) Positioning statements (3 personas)
Positioning summary table
Item	What it signals	Why it’s memorable	Persona fit	Risks/notes
[PM_ADVANCED] “Ship agentic features—by building one in person.”	Execution + internal shipping	“Ship” is the north star	PM_ADVANCED	Requires minimum technical comfort; prework must filter appropriately
[WORKING_PRO] “Turn AI anxiety into a working agent you built.”	Confidence through making	Clear emotional arc + tangible output	WORKING_PRO	Risk of mixed skill levels; must set expectations + support strongly
[FOUNDER] “Prototype an ROI-focused agent with a deployment path + evaluation loop.”	ROI + repeatable system	“ROI + loop” feels operator-grade	FOUNDER	Founders may expect bespoke consulting; must frame cohort experience clearly
Positioning statements (full)
[PM_ADVANCED]
One-sentence positioning (≤25 words):A premium, in-person weekend where PMs and operators build, deploy, and test a working AI agent—so they can ship agentic features at work.
Expanded promise (3–5 sentences):This is for product and ops leaders who are tired of slides and want real implementation instincts. You’ll spend most of the weekend building: short teaching blocks, then pod-based execution with guidance and support. You leave with a working agent, a basic deployment approach you can adapt, and an evaluation/testing workflow to make it measurable. In-person matters here because the hard part isn’t “knowing”—it’s getting unblocked, making decisions, and finishing.
Proof point placeholders (generic, verifiable framing):
* Instructor builds real systems and teaches what he builds (no theory-only curriculum).
* Pod-based build time with guided support (designed for shipping, not browsing).
* Deployment path + evaluation/testing workflow included (not optional add-ons).

[WORKING_PRO]
One-sentence positioning (≤25 words):A structured weekend to turn AI anxiety into a working agent you built—plus a practical deployment and testing workflow you can reuse.
Expanded promise (3–5 sentences):This is for professionals who feel the pressure to “get AI” but want something concrete and credible. You won’t be talked at—this is laptop-open, build-first, with peers and support so you don’t stall out. You’ll leave with a working agent and a repeatable approach to deploying and evaluating it, so you can keep improving after the weekend. The in-person format provides accountability, live troubleshooting, and a calmer signal than online noise.
Proof point placeholders:
* Hands-on build in pods (3–4) to reduce overwhelm and increase completion.
* Clear prework + guided steps to keep the weekend focused and premium.
* Evaluation/testing workflow taught as a practical habit, not a research lecture.

[FOUNDER]
One-sentence positioning (≤25 words):A premium build weekend for founders to prototype an AI agent that saves time or cost—shipped with a deployment path and evaluation loop.
Expanded promise (3–5 sentences):This is for owners who want ROI, not AI theater. Over two days, you’ll prototype an agent aimed at a real business workflow and walk out with something demoable plus a clear next path for deployment and measurement. The value of in-person is speed: you make scope decisions fast, get live support, and finish the build. It’s a cohort build experience—not bespoke consulting—so expectations stay clean and the weekend stays shippable.
Proof point placeholders:
* ROI framing baked into the build (choose a workflow that matters).
* Practical deployment approach + evaluation/testing loop to reduce “it worked once” demos.
* Premium, structured delivery: short instruction → guided build → demo.

Who to choose for Event #1 (pick ONE persona)
Recommendation: [PM_ADVANCED] for the pilot cohort.
Why (grounded in the brief; assumptions labeled):
* The non‑negotiable outcome is that attendees build + deploy + evaluate/test an agent in ~12 hours. PMs/operators are the most likely to have the baseline technical comfort (or at least the implementation mindset) to hit the ≥80% working demo success metric.
* Premium pricing plus “invoice/receipt for reimbursement” language fits PM/operator audiences well. (Assumption: founders’ warm network includes enough PM/operator candidates with professional development budgets.)
* It reduces mixed-level disappointment risk versus a broad working-professional cohort, where “hands-on keyboard” could be too steep without heavier scaffolding.
* It aligns with warm outreach (network + direct outreach) where PM/operator targeting can be precise.

Confidence scores (0.0–1.0)
* Parent brand names: 0.76
* Program names: 0.79
* Taglines: 0.84
* Voice rules: 0.90
* Positioning: 0.87

Rationale (≤10 bullets)
* Chose names that sound like places and modes of work (toolroom, workbench, operator mode) to signal hands-on execution.
* Built “anti-hype” into the semantics (quiet, calm, normal) to match premium credibility and avoid AI buzzword fatigue.
* Used time anchoring (Sunday demo, two days) to make the promise tangible without hype.
* Embedded deployment + evaluation into naming/taglines to differentiate from “prompting classes.”
* Kept language corporate-reimbursement friendly without claiming employer policies.
* Prioritized persona A for the pilot to protect the completion metric and testimonial quality.
* Avoided generic education category terms to prevent “just another bootcamp” perception.
* Flagged rights/trademark uncertainty consistently; no claims about availability.
* Left room to scale beyond one weekend by making the parent brand broader than a single program.
* Ensured every tagline reinforces in-person advantage + shipped outcome (not “learn AI”).


PLAN (sub-questions to answer)
1. What constraints from the Context Brief must the referral program obey (pricing, distribution, tone, “keep it manual”)?
2. What counts as a qualified referral for Event #1 (to match “payment/deposit collected”)?
3. What payout and timing rules are simplest to run manually while protecting against cancellations/refunds?
4. What are the two referral tiers (clear thresholds, clear benefits)?
5. What copy is needed for:
    * the referrer (DM template they can send)
    * the referred attendee (message/email copy they receive)

LOCATE (what to find in the provided material)
From the Context Brief, I need:
* Pricing & purchasing → “$1,500 list… $500 network code… currency TBD… invoice/receipt…”
* Distribution plan → “no paid ads… warm network + LinkedIn… convert only when payment/deposit… don’t add complexity until first 10 deposits…”
* Offer format & promise → “2-day in-person… hands-on… pods… leave with working agent + deployment + eval workflow…”
* Tone/guardrails → “premium, practical… no hype… no job guarantees… make in-person the advantage…”
* Success metrics → “30 paid seats minimum… 50 ideal…” (to ensure referral program nudges paid conversions, not vanity signups)

EXTRACT (minimum necessary excerpts)
Excerpt 1 — Pricing & purchasing
“Working model: $1,500 list price with a $500 ‘network code’ (= $1,000).”“Currency TBD (CAD vs USD).”“Provide invoice/receipt suitable for corporate reimbursement…”
Excerpt 2 — Distribution plan (constraints for simplicity + conversion)
“Do NOT rely on paid ads for the pilot.”“Fill seats via warm network + LinkedIn direct outreach + partner/community channels.”“Convert ‘interest’ only when payment/deposit is collected.”“Don’t add complexity until the first 10 deposits are in.”
Excerpt 3 — Offer format & outcome promise (what the referrer is selling)
“2-day in-person weekend workshop (Sat + Sun), ~6 hours/day.”“Attendees bring laptops; ‘hands-on keyboard,’ not a lecture.”“Outcome promise: attendees leave with (1) a working AI agent, (2) a basic deployment approach, and (3) an evaluation/testing workflow…”
Excerpt 4 — Tone/guardrails
“Premium, practical, outcome-first. No hype, no ‘get rich quick,’ no guaranteed job promises.”“Make in-person the advantage: accountability, hands-on help, peers, shipped outcome.”
Excerpt 5 — Success metric (why referrals must equal paid seats)
“30 paid seats minimum, 50 ideal.”
(Separately, to keep the program itself simple and unambiguous, I’m also applying the “design with simplicity” principle as a general best practice for instructions and operational clarity. )

SOLVE (answer each sub-question using only the excerpts)
1) Constraints the referral program must obey
* Must drive paid conversions, not “interest” (Excerpt 2 + 5).
* Must work with warm outreach / LinkedIn DMs, not ads (Excerpt 2).
* Must preserve premium, outcome-first tone; no hype or job guarantees (Excerpt 4).
* Must align with pricing reality: $1,500 list, $1,000 network-price option; currency TBD; corporate invoice/receipt possible (Excerpt 1).
* Must be simple to run manually (Excerpt 2).
Confidence: 0.95

2) Definition of a “qualified referral” (manual + aligned with “deposit collected”)
Using Excerpt 2 (“convert only when payment/deposit is collected”) and Excerpt 5 (“paid seats”):
Qualified Referral (Event #1):A referred attendee counts when they:
1. register using the referrer’s code (or list referrer name in the checkout “Referral” field), and
2. pay a deposit or pay in full (whichever your checkout supports), and
3. does not request a refund (timing rule below handles this cleanly).
Confidence: 0.85 (High on principle; specific refund mechanics aren’t provided, so I’m choosing a standard operational guardrail.)

3) Payout + timing rules that are simplest and safe
We need something that:
* is meaningful relative to a premium ticket (Excerpt 1)
* pays only after money is real / durable (Excerpt 2, 5)
* doesn’t require complex tooling (Excerpt 2)
Assumption (explicit): Because currency is TBD (Excerpt 1), payouts should be defined as simple flat numbers in “the ticket currency” (CAD if charging CAD, USD if charging USD), and paid after refunds/cancellations are no longer likely (post-event is simplest).
Payout Timing (simple + robust):
* Payout is issued 7 days after Event #1 ends, for each qualified referral who attended Day 1 or whose payment is past your refund window (whichever rule you adopt).
* Payout method (manual-friendly): refund to the referrer’s original payment method (if the referrer is also an attendee) or direct transfer.
Confidence: 0.65 (The “post-event” timing is a best-effort operational choice; refund policy details weren’t provided.)

4) Two referral tiers (clear thresholds)
We want two tiers that are dead-simple:
* Tier threshold based on count of qualified referrals (Excerpt 5 + 2)
* Reward grows at Tier 2 to encourage “one more seat” behavior
Tier design (two-tier, no bonus math):
* Tier 1 (Connector): referrals #1–2
* Tier 2 (Ambassador): referrals #3+ (starting from the 3rd)
Confidence: 0.8

5) Copy required (referrer DM + referred attendee copy)
Copy must:
* emphasize in-person + outcomes (Excerpt 3 + 4)
* avoid hype and job guarantees (Excerpt 4)
* match distribution channels (LinkedIn/warm outreach) (Excerpt 2)
* mention pricing in a careful, “current working model” way (Excerpt 1)
Confidence: 0.85

VERIFY (assumptions, contradictions, weak logic)
Key assumptions I introduced (not present in excerpts):
1. Payout amounts (not specified in context brief).
2. Payout timing rule (post-event / after refund window) because refund policy isn’t provided.
3. Mechanism for tracking (referral codes + sheet) because tooling isn’t specified.
Consistency check vs constraints:
* No paid ads reliance: ✅ (rules discourage public posting/ads; design assumes warm DMs)
* Converts on payment/deposit: ✅ (qualified referral requires deposit/full payment)
* Simple manual ops: ✅ (one code per referrer + simple thresholds + post-event payout)
* Premium tone / no hype: ✅ (copy avoids guarantees, focuses on outcomes and in-person advantage)
* Pricing alignment: ✅ (references list vs network price, acknowledges currency TBD)
No direct contradictions found.

SYNTHESIZE (final deliverable)
Referral Program for Event #1 — Normal Bots (Pilot in Toronto)
A) Program rules
Who qualifies to refer
* Any individual personally invited by the team and given a unique referral code (run this as “invite-only” for Event #1 to keep it manual).
* Referrer must use warm outreach (direct messages, 1:1 intros).
* No paid ads, no coupon sites, no spamming, no mass posting of the code in large deal groups.
What counts as a qualified referral
A referral counts when the referred attendee:
1. Uses the referrer’s unique code at checkout (or enters referrer name in a “Referred by” field), and
2. Pays a deposit or pays in full, and
3. Does not cancel/refund.
First-touch rule: If multiple people claim the same attendee, the code used at checkout wins.
Discount for referred attendees
* Referred attendees receive $500 off list price (i.e., the “network price” — currently $1,000 if list is $1,500), using the referrer’s code.
* One code per order. No stacking with other discounts.
Note: Currency is “the currency you charge tickets in” (CAD or USD).
Payout and timing (manual-friendly)
* Payout is calculated per qualified referral (see tiers below).
* Payout is issued 7 days after the workshop ends, as long as the referred attendee didn’t refund/cancel.
* Payout method:
    * If referrer is an attendee: refund/credit back to the original payment method, or
    * If referrer is not an attendee: direct transfer (e.g., e-transfer).
Simple admin/tracking (manual)
Track in a single sheet with columns:
* Referrer name
* Referrer code
* Referred attendee name + email
* Payment status (deposit/full/invoice paid)
* Tier at time of conversion (1–2 vs 3+)
* Payout owed
* Payout paid? (Y/N) + date

B) Two referral tiers
Tier 1 — “Connector” (referrals #1–2)
* Payout: $150 per qualified referral
Tier 2 — “Ambassador” (referral #3 and onward)
* Payout: $250 per qualified referral (starting with the 3rd)
Optional (non-cash perk, still manual): Ambassadors also get a private 45-minute group Q&A with the instructor after the event (scheduled as one call).(Keep or remove based on appetite; it doesn’t add operational complexity.)

C) Copy for referrers (DM template)
Template 1 — LinkedIn DM (warm + premium)
Hey [Name] — quick one. I’m helping host a premium, in-person AI Agent Build Weekend in Toronto.It’s 2 days / ~12 hours, hands-on (laptop open), small cohort, and you leave with a working agent you built, plus a basic deployment and evaluation/testing workflow.

Sub-questions to answer:
1. What constraints and “non-negotiables” from the context shape pricing (format, audience, positioning, distribution, ops)?
2. For each pricing model, what is the mechanic (how it works in checkout + messaging)?
3. For each model: pros, cons, expected conversion impact, and operational complexity given the pilot constraints.
4. Which model is best as the primary pricing approach for Event #1 vs Event #2, and why?

LOCATE
What I need to find in the provided material (keywords / sections):
* Pricing anchors + discounts: “$1,500 list price”, “$500 network code”, “premium pricing”, “currency TBD”
* Conversion constraints: “Convert ‘interest’ only when payment/deposit is collected”
* Ops constraint: “Don’t add complexity until the first 10 deposits are in”
* Audience + distribution: “warm network”, “LinkedIn direct outreach”, “no paid ads”
* Scale intent: “pilot cohort 30–50”, “repeat 2–3 times”, “scale into Toronto Tech Week”
* Corporate reimbursement positioning: “invoice/receipt… many employers reimburse”

EXTRACT (minimum necessary excerpts)
[E1 — Price anchor + discount mechanism]
“Intended premium pricing. Working model: $1,500 list price with a $500 ‘network code’ (= $1,000).”
[E2 — Currency is not decided]
“Currency TBD (CAD vs USD).”
[E3 — Corporate reimbursement language constraint]
“Provide invoice/receipt suitable for corporate reimbursement; avoid claiming all companies provide a specific stipend—phrase as ‘many employers reimburse professional development.’”
[E4 — Distribution constraint (no ads)]
“Do NOT rely on paid ads for the pilot. Fill seats via warm network + LinkedIn direct outreach + partner/community channels.”
[E5 — What counts as real conversion]
“Convert ‘interest’ only when payment/deposit is collected.”
[E6 — Pilot ops constraint]
“Don’t add complexity until the first 10 deposits are in.”
[E7 — Cohort size target]
“Run a small pilot cohort (Event #1) of ~30–50 paid attendees…”
[E8 — Repeat + scale timeline]
“…then repeat 2–3 times and scale into a larger presence around Toronto Tech Week in late May 2026.”

SOLVE (pricing models, grounded in excerpts)
(1) Premium list price + discount code (network code)
Mechanic (how it works):
* Set a premium public list price (anchored by [E1]).
* Use a limited “network code” discount for warm channels (explicitly named in [E1], distributed via [E4]).
* Checkout supports code entry; receipt supports reimbursement language ([E3]).
Pros (in this context):
* Strong anchoring: keeps “premium” positioning intact while still allowing access ([E1]).
* Fits warm network fill: discount is delivered through warm outreach and partners, not mass ads ([E4]).
* Simple enough for Event #1: minimal ops overhead vs multi-stage billing; aligns with “don’t add complexity” ([E6]).
Cons:
* Discount leakage risk: codes can spread beyond intended channels, eroding price discrimination (not explicitly in text; inference).
* Perceived unfairness if some attendees pay $1,500 and others $1,000 unless messaging is clean (inference).
* Can train the market to “wait for a code” if not tightly controlled (inference).
Expected conversion impact (directional):
* High uplift for warm leads who are price-sensitive (because effective price is $1,000 with code per [E1]).
* Neutral to mildly negative for full-price prospects if they discover codes widely (inference).Overall: positive for Event #1 because distribution is warm and controlled ([E4]).
Operational complexity:
* Low (single payment, optional code field).
* Complexity becomes medium only if you manage many unique codes or partner-specific tracking (inference).
Event recommendation:
* Event #1: Recommended as the primary model (best match to [E1], [E4], [E6]).
* Event #2: Still useful, but tighten: make codes partner-specific or limited to avoid discount creep (inference).
Confidence: 0.85 (Strongly grounded in [E1], [E4], [E6]; conversion implications are directional/inferred.)

(2) Early bird pricing
Mechanic:
* Offer a time- or seat-limited lower price (e.g., first N seats or until date), then revert to list price. List price anchor exists in [E1]; the early-bird idea is not explicitly in the brief, so this is a proposed structure.
Pros:
* Creates urgency and accelerates cash collection—important when you need paid seats ([E5]).
* Can help hit “first 10 deposits” quickly (aligns with [E6] outcome intent, though mechanism differs).
* Keeps public pricing “cleaner” than secret discount codes (inference).
Cons:
* Adds rules (deadlines/seat caps) that can create support overhead: “Is early bird still available?” (inference).
* If you already have a network-code strategy ([E1]), early bird can confuse the offer architecture (“Which discount applies?”) (inference).
* Can annoy late buyers if not handled carefully (inference).
Expected conversion impact (directional):
* Likely moderate positive at the start (drives earlier purchase decisions).
* Might be less effective than network codes for Event #1 if your acquisition is mostly warm 1:1 outreach ([E4])—because urgency is already created by direct asks (inference).
Operational complexity:
* Low–medium: you need time/seat gating and clear communications, but it’s still single payment.
Event recommendation:
* Event #1: Not the primary model—it risks adding “rules” while you’re trying to keep ops simple ([E6]) and you already have the network code concept ([E1]).
* Event #2: Recommended once you have proof and broader inbound interest (post-pilot), to accelerate fill without handing out codes everywhere (inference), and supports repeat/scale ([E8]).
Confidence: 0.65 (Mechanic is a proposal; fit is inferred from [E4], [E6], [E8].)

(3) Deposit + remainder
Mechanic:
* Collect a smaller amount now to reserve the seat (deposit), then collect the remainder later. This is compatible with [E5] (“payment/deposit is collected” counts as conversion).
Pros:
* Directly aligned to your conversion definition: deposits count as real commitment ([E5]).
* Helps reach the “first 10 deposits” milestone faster ([E6]) by lowering initial friction (inference).
* Can reduce “I need approval” stalling, while still locking in commitment (inference).
* Can be positioned as: “Deposit reserves your seat; remainder due by X date” (inference).
Cons:
* Operational complexity: chasing remainders, handling defaults, refunds, and replacement seats—this can violate the “don’t add complexity” spirit if introduced too early ([E6]) (inference).
* Requires clear policies (cancellation, transferability), otherwise you’ll burn time in support (inference).
* Revenue timing: you may feel “sold out” on deposits, but cash is incomplete (inference).
Expected conversion impact (directional):
* High positive for “interested but hesitant” leads (lower immediate commitment).
* Potential negative on realized revenue if some deposits never convert (inference).
Operational complexity:
* Medium–high relative to single-pay models (billing schedule, reminders, reconciliation).
Event recommendation:
* Event #1: Use only as an escape hatch, not the default—because of [E6]. Concretely: keep default as pay-in-full; offer deposit only for corporate approval cases or by request (inference).
* Event #2: More viable as a standard option once you’ve proven demand and have ops muscle (inference), but still increases complexity.
Confidence: 0.75 (Deposit-as-conversion is directly grounded in [E5]; ops tradeoffs are inferred.)

(4) Corporate group pricing
Mechanic:
* Offer tiered per-seat pricing for teams (e.g., 3+ seats, 5+ seats), with invoice/receipt suitable for reimbursement ([E3]).
* Could be positioned as “send 3–5 people and build together,” which matches pod-based learning (inference, but consistent with workshop structure in the brief).
Pros:
* Higher seat velocity: a single decision fills multiple seats, important for 30–50 target ([E7]) (inference).
* Aligns with reimbursement reality: invoice/receipt language already planned ([E3]).
* Supports repeatability and scaling efforts ([E8])—teams returning each cohort (inference).
Cons:
* Longer sales cycles and procurement friction (inference). That can clash with quick pilot fill needs if you depend on it too early (inference).
* Higher ops: invoicing, PO requests, multiple attendees, substitutions, etc. (inference).
* If discounting too aggressively, you undercut premium brand (inference).
Expected conversion impact (directional):
* High impact per deal (one yes → many seats).
* Mixed impact on speed: may slow time-to-cash if companies need internal approvals (inference).
Operational complexity:
* Medium–high: invoicing workflows, tracking attendees, and payment terms; but you already plan to support receipts/invoices ([E3]).
Event recommendation:
* Event #1: Offer it selectively (for warm corporate leads), but do not rely on it as the only path—because you’re avoiding complexity early ([E6]) and filling via warm channels broadly ([E4]).
* Event #2: Strongly recommended as an explicit lane, because you’ll have proof + content + credibility from Event #1, making team sales easier (inference) and supports scaling ([E8]).
Confidence: 0.70 (Invoice/receipt need is grounded in [E3]; conversion/ops dynamics are inferred.)

VERIFY (assumptions, contradictions, weak spots)
1. Conversion impact is inherently uncertain without funnel baselines (reply rates, lead volume, % corporate vs individual). I kept impact directional rather than numeric.
2. Model (3) Deposit + remainder conflicts with “don’t add complexity until first 10 deposits” if used broadly ([E6]). I addressed this by recommending deposit as a limited fallback for Event #1.
3. Early bird vs network code: running both simultaneously can confuse the market. Since the context already proposes a network code ([E1]), I recommend early bird primarily for Event #2 (cleaner public funnel).
4. Currency is explicitly TBD ([E2]); I avoided recommending specific CAD vs USD pricing.

SYNTHESIZE (final answer you can act on)
Quick comparison table (directional)
Model	Expected conversion impact	Ops complexity	Best for Event #1?	Best for Event #2?
(1) List price + discount code	High for warm network	Low	Yes (primary)	Yes (tighter controls)
(2) Early bird	Medium (front-loads buys)	Low–Medium	Not primary	Yes (primary lane)
(3) Deposit + remainder	High for hesitant leads	Med–High	Limited use only	Optional / yes if ops ready
(4) Corporate group pricing	High per deal, slower cycle	Med–High	Selective	Yes (explicit lane)
Recommended primary model by event
Event #1 (pilot, fill via warm outreach, keep ops simple):Primary: (1) Premium list price + targeted network code ([E1], [E4], [E6])Secondary “only if needed” escape hatches:
* (3) Deposit only for “needs approval” cases (still counts as conversion per [E5])
* (4) Corporate group pricing only for warm corporate intros, with clean invoicing language ([E3])
Event #2 (after proof + content, more inbound/partner leverage, repeatability):Run a cleaner two-lane structure:
* Public lane: (2) Early bird → then list price (helps velocity and reduces reliance on “secret” codes)
* B2B lane: (4) Corporate group pricing with invoice/receipt framing ([E3])Keep (1) discount codes limited to partners/ambassadors rather than broadly distributed to protect pricing integrity.

Notes on wording (to stay inside your messaging guardrails)
When describing reimbursement, stick to: “Many employers reimburse professional development—we provide invoices/receipts suitable for reimbursement.” ([E3])

If you want, I can turn the above into a single-page pricing policy doc (refunds, transfers, deposit rules, deadlines) that matches the “premium + organized” experience—but I didn’t include it here because it goes beyond what you explicitly asked.

PLAN
Sub-questions to answer:
1. What are the hardest, most purchase-blocking objections a skeptical attendee would raise about paying [PRICE]?
2. How do we answer them crisply (≤70 words each) while staying aligned to the offer’s non‑negotiables and tone guardrails?
3. How do we cover the specific themes you flagged:
    * “I can learn free online”
    * “I’m not technical”
    * “Will this help my job”
    * “Is this a scam”
    * “What if I’m busy”
    * “Corporate reimbursement”
    * “Why in-person”
LOCATE
From your context brief, I need the precise offer constraints and promises to anchor answers:
* Format: 2-day weekend, ~6 hours/day, hands-on, pods + guided build time
* Outcomes: working agent, deployment approach, evaluation/testing workflow
* Pricing/reimbursement: premium, invoice/receipt, “many employers reimburse…”
* Messaging: premium/practical, no hype, no guaranteed job promises, in-person advantage
EXTRACT (minimum necessary excerpts)
1. “2-day in-person weekend workshop (Sat + Sun), ~6 hours/day, total ~12 hours.”
2. “Hands-on keyboard, not a lecture… short teaching blocks → pods of 3–4 → guided build time with support.”
3. “Outcome promise: attendees leave with (1) a working AI agent, (2) a basic deployment approach, and (3) an evaluation/testing workflow.”
4. “Pricing… $1,500 list with a $500 ‘network code’ (= $1,000)… Provide invoice/receipt suitable for corporate reimbursement… phrase as ‘many employers reimburse professional development.’”
5. “Tone… Premium, practical, outcome-first. No hype… no guaranteed job promises. Make in-person the advantage: accountability, hands-on help, peers, shipped outcome.”
SOLVE (20 objections + crisp answers)
Replace [PRICE] with your chosen price (e.g., list vs network code).
1. Objection: “I can learn all of this for free online. Why pay [PRICE]?”Answer: You absolutely can learn the pieces online. At [PRICE], you’re paying for speed + outcome: a curated 12‑hour build path, live debugging help, a pod that keeps you moving, and a finished agent you demo on Day 2 with a deployment and evaluation workflow. Most people don’t lack info—they lack a shipped result.
2. Objection: “[PRICE] is insane when online courses are like $99.”Answer: If you want content, buy a course. At [PRICE], this is a build sprint: small cohort, hands-on support, structured pods, and real-time feedback so you don’t stall on setup, bugs, or “what do I do next?” The value isn’t videos—it’s walking out with a working agent, a deployment path, and a repeatable testing approach you can reuse.
3. Objection: “I’m not technical. I don’t code. I’ll be lost.”Answer: This isn’t a lecture—you will touch the keyboard. You don’t need to be a software engineer, but you should be comfortable following step-by-step instructions in a code editor and running simple commands. We provide starter templates, clear prework, and pod support so you’re not stuck alone. If you want passive learning, this weekend won’t fit.
4. Objection: “What if I’m the slowest person in the room? I hate looking dumb.”Answer: That’s exactly why we use pods of 3–4 and guided build time. You won’t be stranded. The flow is short teaching blocks → build sprints with support → regroup. We also set expectations up front and provide prework so everyone starts from the same baseline. The goal isn’t showing off—it’s finishing.
5. Objection: “Will this actually help my job, or is it just a fun weekend project?”Answer: The output is designed for work: you leave with an agent you built, a basic deployment approach, and an evaluation/testing workflow so you can assess quality—not just “it seems to work.” No workshop can promise promotions, but this helps you ship faster, scope agentic features realistically, and lead adoption conversations with engineers and stakeholders.
6. Objection: “I don’t want to build a toy demo. I need something production-relevant.”Answer: We’re not promising you’ll ship to production in two days. We are promising you’ll learn the workflow that bridges demo → deploy: clear requirements, data boundaries, basic deployment patterns, and evaluation. You’ll build something that actually runs end-to-end, and you’ll leave knowing what the next hardening steps are for your environment.
7. Objection: “AI tools change every month. Won’t this be outdated by next quarter?”Answer: Tools change; fundamentals compound. The weekend is structured around durable skills: agent design patterns, prompt + tool orchestration, retrieval/evaluation concepts, and how to test reliability. We’ll use current tooling as the vehicle, but you’ll leave with a mental model and workflow you can adapt as APIs and frameworks evolve.
8. Objection: “Is this a scam? I’ve seen a lot of AI grifts.”Answer: Healthy skepticism is fair. We’re keeping it concrete: a public agenda, clear learning outcomes, an in-person venue in downtown Toronto, and a receipt/invoice suitable for corporate reimbursement. The instructor teaches what he builds—no “get rich quick” promises, no job guarantees, just a hands-on build with demos at the end.
9. Objection: “Who are you to teach this? Plenty of ‘AI experts’ don’t build real systems.”Answer: You should demand proof. The instructor is a senior AI leader building real agentic systems in production, and the curriculum is based on what’s actually deployed: guardrails, evaluation, and basic deployment. We’ll share verifiable credentials and concrete examples of the kinds of systems and constraints we work with—without hype or vague “thought leadership.”
10. Objection: “Why in-person? Just do it on Zoom and charge less.”Answer: Because the promise is a shipped outcome, not passive consumption. In-person lets us do what online can’t: hands-on setup, live debugging, pod accountability, and rapid feedback when your agent fails in weird ways. Two days together compresses weeks of trial-and-error—especially for people who keep “almost starting” online.
11. Objection: “I’m too busy. Giving up a whole weekend is a big ask.”Answer: Totally fair. This is designed as a focused 12-hour sprint: short teaching blocks, structured build time, and prework that reduces day-one friction. If you’re already overwhelmed, a weekend workshop may not be the right moment. If you’re tired of “someday I’ll learn this,” blocking one weekend can be the cleanest way to finally ship something.
12. Objection: “What if I have to miss part of a day? Life happens.”Answer: We structure the weekend so you can recover: each build block has clear milestones, and your pod can keep moving while you step away. You’ll also have the scaffolded materials and a deployment/testing checklist to continue after. That said, the full value comes from being present for both days—because the goal is a working demo by Sunday.
13. Objection: “My company won’t reimburse [PRICE].”Answer: Some companies won’t—but many do reimburse professional development. If yours does, [PRICE] can be justified because you’ll leave with a working agent, a deployment path, and an evaluation/testing workflow—not just notes. We’ll provide an invoice/receipt suitable for reimbursement, and we frame it as practical upskilling tied to delivery (not “AI inspiration”).
14. Objection: “Finance is strict. I need a proper invoice/receipt and clear currency.”Answer: Understood. We’ll handle this like a professional workshop: clear checkout, formal receipt/invoice, and details your finance team expects (date, vendor, description). Currency and payment method will be clearly stated before you pay, so there’s no surprise. If your company needs extra documentation, we can share a simple one‑pager summary of the curriculum and outcomes.
15. Objection: “How do I know I’ll actually finish an agent in two days?”Answer: No one can guarantee 100% completion, but we’re designing for ≥80% of attendees to build and demo by end of Day 2: pods of 3–4, guided build blocks, and an explicit outcome promise. You won’t be starting from a blank screen—there will be a scaffolded starting point and staff support to unblock you quickly.
16. Objection: “I’m worried it’ll be too advanced… or too basic.”Answer: That’s why we’ll choose a single primary persona for Event #1 and design the weekend around it. The workshop isn’t meant to be everything for everyone. The promise is: if you match the target profile and complete the prework, you’ll build a working agent with a deployment and evaluation workflow. Clear expectations beat a mixed room.
17. Objection: “Why pods? I’m paying [PRICE]—I don’t want to rely on strangers.”Answer: Pods aren’t outsourcing the teaching—they’re the force multiplier. Building agents involves lots of small blockers; pods help you move faster, compare approaches, and stay accountable. You’ll still get instructor guidance and structured build time. The pod format is how we turn 12 hours into a shipped result instead of “interesting notes.”
18. Objection: “I can’t use company data. Privacy/security makes this pointless.”Answer: You don’t need to. We’ll use safe, non-sensitive sample data and a clean project scaffold so you can learn the workflow without exposing anything proprietary. The goal is transferable patterns: how to define tasks, connect tools, deploy a basic version, and evaluate. After the weekend, you can re-implement the same approach inside your environment.
19. Objection: “If the Wi‑Fi is bad or my laptop setup breaks, the whole weekend is wasted.”Answer: Hands-on workshops live or die on ops, so we’re choosing a professional venue with strong Wi‑Fi and a setup designed for laptops and pods. We also provide prework to get your environment ready before Day 1, and we’ll have a clear troubleshooting path during the build blocks. The aim is a smooth, premium experience—not chaos.
20. Objection: “I’ll go back to work and never touch it again. Then [PRICE] was wasted.”Answer: That’s a real risk with any learning. We design for carryover: you leave with a working agent, a deployment checklist, and an evaluation workflow you can re-run. Plus you’ll have peers you can sanity‑check with. If your goal is “consume info,” you won’t get ROI. If your goal is “ship one real thing,” this weekend is built for that.
Confidence: 0.90 (high confidence these objections + answers are grounded in your stated offer constraints and tone guardrails; lower confidence only where implementation details aren’t specified, like extra finance docs beyond invoice/receipt.)

Context Brief

(attach this above the prompt)

Project: Launch a premium, in-person “AI Agent Build Weekend” workshop in Toronto (GTA). Working brand: “Normal Bots” (pending final approval/rights check). Founders: Adil (instructor/content lead) + Mo (operator/demand/logistics lead).

Big picture: Run a small pilot cohort (Event #1) of ~30–50 paid attendees, deliver a truly hands-on 2-day build experience (12 total hours), capture strong proof (testimonials + short clips + attendee posts), then repeat 2–3 times and scale into a larger presence around Toronto Tech Week in late May 2026.

Why now (market context):
- Toronto is a dense tech + AI market and an ideal city to fill 30–50 seats via warm outreach (no ads required).
- There’s a known “AI anxiety” tailwind: professionals want practical skills, not online noise.
- If targeting Muslim community channels, note Ramadan timing (Toronto Ramadan is expected to begin mid-Feb 2026; schedule accordingly).

Offer format (non-negotiables):
- 2-day in-person weekend workshop (Sat + Sun), ~6 hours/day, total ~12 hours.
- Attendees bring laptops; the experience is “hands-on keyboard,” not a lecture.
- Structure: short teaching blocks → pods of 3–4 → guided build time with support.
- Outcome promise: attendees leave with (1) a working AI agent they built, (2) a basic deployment approach, and (3) an evaluation/testing workflow (e.g., RAG-style evaluation concepts).
- Experience should feel premium and organized (clear agenda, prework, pods, support, smooth ops). No alcohol. Simple catering is fine.

Primary persona (choose ONE for Event #1 to avoid mixed-level disappointment):
Option A (Advanced): tech product managers / operators who want to become “AI-ready” and ship agentic features internally.
Option B (Broader): working professionals/managers who fear AI displacement and want practical workflow automation skills.
Option C (Founder): founders/owners (6–7 figure) who want ROI-focused AI systems (cost down / throughput up).

Pricing & purchasing:
- Intended premium pricing. Working model: $1,500 list price with a $500 “network code” (= $1,000).
- Currency TBD (CAD vs USD).
- Provide invoice/receipt suitable for corporate reimbursement; avoid claiming all companies provide a specific stipend—phrase as “many employers reimburse professional development.”

Credibility (use as proof, not bragging):
- Instructor is a senior AI leader building real systems (not just theory). Use concise, verifiable proof points and emphasize “teaches what he builds.”

Distribution plan (Event #1):
- Do NOT rely on paid ads for the pilot.
- Fill seats via warm network + LinkedIn direct outreach + partner/community channels.
- Convert “interest” only when payment/deposit is collected.
- Don’t add complexity until the first 10 deposits are in.

Venue requirements:
- Downtown Toronto professional setting; target capacity up to ~50.
- Must have strong Wi‑Fi, projector/screen, tables suitable for laptops, and pod-friendly seating.
- Initial venue path is a weekend space via a partner org connection (law firm meeting space).

Roles & accountability:
- Adil: owns curriculum, delivery, and participant outcomes (quality/NPS). If attendees hate it, it’s a delivery/content failure.
- Mo: owns demand generation, landing page + checkout, ops/logistics polish, content capture plan, and the post-event growth loop. If seats aren’t filled, it’s a demand failure.

Success metrics (Event #1):
- 30 paid seats minimum (viability), 50 ideal.
- ≥80% of attendees successfully build and demo a working agent by end of Day 2.
- Capture: 10 video testimonials, 20 written quotes, 20–30 attendee LinkedIn posts, and enough footage for 10–20 short clips.
- Build a waitlist for Cohort #2 immediately after Event #1.

Tone/guardrails for messaging:
- Premium, practical, outcome-first. No hype, no “get rich quick,” no guaranteed job promises.
- Acknowledge job-change anxiety ethically (“stay relevant,” “work faster,” “lead adoption”) without fearmongering.
- Make in-person the advantage: accountability, hands-on help, peers, shipped outcome.

What we want the prompt generator to produce (deliverables):
- Landing page wireframe + full copy (for each persona option).
- Outreach sequences (LinkedIn DM, email, follow-ups) + objection handling.
- Referral/ambassador program language (simple enough to run manually).
- Agenda/run-of-show + prework checklist + pod worksheet template.
- Post-event survey + testimonial prompts + content repurposing plan.
- Simple operating plan for repeating cohorts and scaling into late May (Toronto Tech Week).

END CONTEXT BRIEF

Original prompt

A) Meeting analysis: what’s actually being built (and why it can work)
The offer is a “proof-of-value weekend bootcamp,” not a talk event.The differentiator is the outcome promise: arrive Saturday with no agent → leave Sunday with a built + deployed agent and evaluation practice (T1). The meeting repeatedly frames the first event as a thesis test (T7) and a content flywheel toward a bigger moment like Toronto Tech Week (T8).
Unique value-adds that make the partnership complementary
* Adil’s edge = trust + curriculum ownership + deliveryHe anchors the product in “enterprise-grade” framing and insists attendees pay for hands-on transformation (T1–T2). The web footprint for Aadil Kazmi strengthens this authority story in supply-chain/AI: Head of AI at Infios with agentic-AI roadmap scope; founder/CEO experience raising capital (W1–W4).
* Mo’s edge = distribution + packaging + operational leverageMo naturally thinks in brand, funnels, referral engines, and content capture—plus he has the “room-filling” network (T5, T9) and is already thinking about landing page, editors, and “experience design” (T6).
The main strategic fork (and what I’d recommend)You have two viable “Event #1” routes:
1. Route A — “AI Agent Bootcamp for PMs (advanced)”Pros: highest willingness-to-pay, easiest to justify premium price, fastest corporate reimbursement.Cons: smaller market, higher expectations, must be truly advanced.
2. Route B — “AI Agent Bootcamp for Working Professionals (beginner-to-intermediate)”Pros: bigger TAM, fear-driven urgency (T10), easier to fill quickly in Toronto.Cons: you must keep the curriculum accessible and avoid scaring beginners with jargon.
Recommendation for Event #1: Pick one primary persona to reduce mismatch risk. Keep Route A as Event #2 if you start with Route B (or vice versa). That keeps the “incremental execution” philosophy intact (T7).

B) Web deep-dive on Aadil Kazmi: usable credibility bullets + “how to use them”
From public sources:
* Head of AI at Infios (intelligent supply chain execution). 
* Role focuses on agentic AI roadmap across order/warehouse/transportation management. 
* Experience includes founding a Shopify-backed startup and scaling large data/AI pipelines at Amazon and Fortune 100s. 
* As founder/CEO of Swyft, raised $22M CAD Series A (co-led by Inovia and Forerunner; Shopify participated). 
How to translate that into messaging (no fluff):
* “Built and deployed AI in real supply-chain environments (not demos).”
* “Has founder experience: understands ROI, adoption, and constraints.”
* “Teaches ‘agentic AI’ with governance/roadmap thinking, not just prompts.”
Credibility assets you should harvest digitally (not grunt-work, but high-level list):
* 1-page “Instructor credibility” sheet with 4 bullets above + links to Infios announcement and BetaKit story (for social proof). 
* 60-second “why this matters now” video script (see prompt pack below).
* A “what you’ll build” demo clip (even a screen recording) to anchor the outcome.

C) Toronto locality: what to lean into (and the hidden reasons)
Market density (hard fact): Toronto is a major tech hub with ~289,000 technology workers. This supports your “surgical outreach fills 30–50 seats” logic.
AI momentum (hard fact): CBRE notes Toronto has a large AI talent pool (~23,936) and ranks No. 3 in its tech talent ranking. Hidden implication: lots of people feel AI proximity pressure—their peers are leveling up, and they don’t want to be left behind.
Distribution moments: Toronto Tech Week runs May 25–29, 2026. Hidden implication: your “3 pilots → blow it up at TTW” plan is structurally sound, because TTW is a concentrated attention window.
Religious calendar constraint (if you want “before Ramadan”): Ramadan in Toronto is expected to begin around Feb 18, 2026. Hidden implication: a late-Feb weekend event will change scheduling preferences (shorter day, later start, or “Iftar-friendly” design). If you keep it open to all but market to Muslim orgs, plan accordingly.
Community channels referenced: MAX frames itself around professional development; MIST has deep logistics experience for large youth events. Hidden implication: these channels aren’t just “audience”—they’re distribution, volunteers, and venue access.

D) Everything you need (items checklist) + “how I can do it digitally”
Below is the complete stack of what’s needed. For each item, I’m stating what I can provide digitally (templates, prompts, checklists, scripts) so you/your team can execute.
1. Offer definition (1-page): persona, promise, prerequisites, outcomes, agenda
    * I can generate: offer doc structure + versioned variants for Route A vs Route B.
2. Pricing & packaging (incl. discount logic, refunds, invoicing language)
    * I can generate: pricing experiments, refund policy options, invoice/receipt language, “corporate reimbursement” FAQ.
3. Brand kit (name decision, tagline, tone, one-paragraph story)
    * I can generate: naming matrix, taglines, messaging pillars, “brand voice” rules.
4. Landing page (sections + copy + FAQ + objection handling)
    * I can generate: page copy, layout plan, trust proof blocks, CTA variants, FAQ.
5. Checkout & registration flow (payment → confirmation → prework email → reminders)
    * I can generate: the full email/SMS sequence copy + “ops checklist” for what triggers when.
6. Curriculum + prework (what to install, accounts, starter repo, safety rails)
    * I can generate: curriculum outline templates, prework checklist, “pod worksheet” structure, learning objectives.
7. Venue & AV requirements (room layout, projector, wifi, whiteboards)
    * I can generate: venue requirements doc + run-of-show + contingency plans.
8. Food & accessibility (dietary survey, halal/veg, breaks, prayer-friendly schedule if relevant)
    * I can generate: attendee survey questions + scheduling templates.
9. Content capture (videographer shot list, interview questions, release forms)
    * I can generate: shot list, micro-interview prompts, post-event content plan.
10. Distribution plan (surgical outreach + referrals + partner channels)
* I can generate: LinkedIn DM scripts, email scripts, referral program terms, partner pitch deck outline.
1. Post-event conversion loop (testimonials, NPS, next cohort waitlist, corporate upsell)
* I can generate: survey, testimonial prompts, case-study template, follow-up sequence.

E) Outline → Plan → Single action steps
Outline (high level)
Phase 0 — Decide the “one-room promise” (48 hours):Pick Route A or Route B. Lock outcomes and who the event is for.
Phase 1 — Build Event #1 engine (7–10 days):Landing page + checkout + outreach scripts + curriculum skeleton + venue date confirmation.
Phase 2 — Fill 30–50 seats (10–21 days):Targeted outreach + partner referrals + deposits collected.
Phase 3 — Deliver + capture proof (event weekend):Run the workshop, capture content, get measurable learning outcomes + testimonials.
Phase 4 — Repeat x2, then Toronto Tech Week scale:Two more cohorts → package results → apply/host at TTW May 25–29, 2026.

Plan (mid level)
Plan Track A (PM advanced) — if you choose it
* Outcome: “Build + deploy an AI agent workflow and evaluate it; ship an internal demo.”
* Proof: “Before/after” capability + LinkedIn posts from PMs.
Plan Track B (working professional / normies)
* Outcome: “Build 1 practical agent that saves time weekly + deploy it + understand safe usage.”
* Proof: time saved, workflow automation examples, “I can do this now” testimonials.
Toronto schedule note
If you truly want “before Ramadan,” a late-Feb weekend won’t qualify in 2026. So either:
* Option 1: run earlier in Feb, or
* Option 2: run during Ramadan with an adjusted schedule (later start, end near iftar, lighter catering), or
* Option 3: avoid Ramadan marketing channels for Event #1 and keep it “downtown professional” audience only.

Single action steps (atomic, one action each)
I’m writing these as “do one thing” steps. Where helpful, I’m also indicating (In-person only) vs (Digital).
1. Choose Event #1 primary persona (PM advanced OR working professionals).
2. Lock the outcome statement in 1 sentence (“You will leave with ___”).
3. Confirm brand usage rights for “Normal Bots” (any prior partner constraints).
4. Pick event date(s) that match the audience and calendar constraints.
5. Ask the venue contact for 2–3 available weekend slots (capacity, AV, Wi‑Fi). (In-person coordination, but request is digital)
6. Define the agenda blocks: teach / build / deploy / evaluate.
7. Write the prerequisites list (accounts, installs, skill assumptions).
8. Create the landing page structure (hero → promise → agenda → instructor proof → FAQs → CTA). (Digital)
9. Decide pricing & discount scheme ($1,500 list + $500 code, or $1,000 flat).
10. Write the refund policy (time-bound, clear).
11. Set up checkout + receipt/invoice language for corporate reimbursement. (Digital)
12. Create a list of 80–120 “best fit” prospects from your networks (not 500).
13. Draft the 3-message LinkedIn DM sequence (invite → follow-up → last call). (Digital)
14. Draft the partner/referrer DM (“bring 2 people, you get ___”). (Digital)
15. Send 20 DMs/day for 5 days (or delegate to a VA).
16. Collect 10 paid deposits before doing any “big” production spend.
17. Send the prework email immediately after purchase. (Digital)
18. Run a 30‑minute optional “setup clinic” (virtual) mid-week to reduce day‑of friction. (Digital)
19. Print pod worksheets + name cards. (In-person execution)
20. Run the event (delivery, facilitation). (In-person)
21. Capture 10 micro-testimonials on-site (15 seconds each). (In-person capture)
22. Send post-event survey within 2 hours. (Digital)
23. Publish 3 proof posts (results + photos + quotes). (Digital)
24. Open waitlist for Event #2 with a date and limited seats. (Digital)
25. Repeat once before adding complexity (tracks, sponsors, TTW).

F) Example messaging/language (channel-ready)
I’m keeping this aligned with what’s in the meeting: outcome-first, hands-on, credibility, and fear handled without being cringe.
1) LinkedIn DM (professional, outcome-forward)
“Hey [Name] — quick one. I’m running a 2‑day, in‑person workshop in downtown Toronto where you’ll build + deploy your first AI agent (laptop, hands-on). It’s designed for [persona].If you’re using (or about to use) AI at work and want to go beyond prompts, this is the fastest way I know. Want the details?”
2) DM follow-up (objection: “I’m busy / why pay?”)
“Totally fair. This isn’t a talk — it’s 12 hours of guided build time.You’ll leave with: (1) working agent, (2) deployment path, (3) evaluation basics.If it’s not a priority right now, no stress — want me to put you on the waitlist for the next cohort?”
3) Landing page hero line (Route B: normies)
“Stop guessing about AI. In one weekend, build an AI agent that saves you hours every week — with guidance, templates, and a deploy plan.”
4) Landing page hero line (Route A: PM advanced)
“From ‘AI curious’ to ‘AI shipping.’ Build + deploy an agentic workflow and learn evaluation patterns product teams actually use.”
5) “Corporate reimbursement” copy (safer than claiming universal $3k)
“Many employers reimburse professional development. We provide a receipt/invoice for training reimbursement. If you’re unsure, ask your manager/L&D team.”
(And if you want to reference the existence of formal learning credits without overclaiming, you can mention Canada’s training credit as an example that structured training reimbursement exists.)

G) Persona map + the “hidden reason” each responds to
Below are multiple personas (multiple paths). For each: surface desire, hidden driver, and what to emphasize.
1. Mid-level tech PM / operator
    * Desire: stay relevant, lead AI projects
    * Hidden driver: status + internal competitiveness
    * Emphasize: “ship something,” “evaluation,” “deployment,” “talk track for stakeholders”
2. Non-technical manager in big company
    * Desire: not fall behind, automate busywork
    * Hidden driver: fear of redundancy + workload burnout
    * Emphasize: “time saved,” “practical agent,” “no fluff,” “bring to your team Monday”
3. Founder / SMB owner
    * Desire: reduce headcount pressure, increase output
    * Hidden driver: survival + margin pressure
    * Emphasize: “automation ROI,” “repeatable workflows,” “agent as an operator”
4. Consultant / agency / freelancer
    * Desire: new offer, higher rates
    * Hidden driver: commoditization fear
    * Emphasize: “productized AI offers,” “deliverables,” “client-ready workflows”
5. Mid‑career switcher (35–50)
    * Desire: restart trajectory without going back to school
    * Hidden driver: identity + regret avoidance
    * Emphasize: “structured path,” “weekend commitment,” “community + support”
6. Early-career / student (lower price later)
    * Desire: get first job edge
    * Hidden driver: scarcity + uncertainty
    * Emphasize: “portfolio piece,” “demo,” “mentor feedback”

Prompt 17 — Founder ROI messaging“Write founder-focused messaging emphasizing ROI, automation, and operating leverage.Output: 5 short founder DMs, 3 landing page hero variants, 6 bullet benefits with quantified examples.”

H) Practical recommendation to “make this work” with your constraint
Since you + Adil are “in-person only,” the highest leverage is:
* Use digital assets (landing page + DM scripts + partner pitch + follow-up sequences) to ensure paid commitment before you do anything heavy.
* Keep Event #1 simple, but instrumented: prework, clear outcomes, survey, testimonials.
* Choose one persona for Event #1 to prevent mixed-level dissatisfaction.
* Align date with the calendar reality if you want the Muslim community channels (Ramadan constraint). 
If you want, I can generate an additional “prompt pack” specifically for:
* corporate L&D bulk purchase outreach,
* sponsorship outreach after Event #1,
* or a Toronto Tech Week event application + event description + partner list approach (grounded in TTW’s “host an event” model)


1) PLAN
Sub-questions to answer:
1. What transformations does the workshop credibly promise (outcome, format, experience)?
2. What angles define each category (fear / ambition / ROI / community / credibility) without adding new claims?
3. Can we produce 25 one-liners that all match: “In one weekend, you go from ___ to ___.” and stay <14 words?

2) LOCATE
What I need to pull from the brief (keywords/sections):
* Why now → “AI anxiety,” “practical skills,” “online noise”
* Offer format (non-negotiables) → “2-day,” “hands-on keyboard,” “pods,” “guided build,” “premium”
* Outcome promise → “working AI agent,” “deployment approach,” “evaluation/testing workflow”
* Personas → “fear AI displacement,” “ROI-focused,” “cost down / throughput up”
* Credibility → “senior AI leader,” “teaches what he builds”
* In-person advantage → “accountability,” “hands-on help,” “peers,” “shipped outcome”
No missing documents needed.

3) EXTRACT (minimum necessary excerpts)
E1 (fear / context): “There’s a known ‘AI anxiety’ tailwind: professionals want practical skills, not online noise.”
E2 (format): “2-day in-person weekend workshop (Sat + Sun), ~6 hours/day, total ~12 hours.”
E3 (hands-on): “Attendees bring laptops; the experience is ‘hands-on keyboard,’ not a lecture.”
E4 (pods/support): “Structure: short teaching blocks → pods of 3–4 → guided build time with support.”
E5 (outcomes): “Outcome promise: attendees leave with (1) a working AI agent they built, (2) a basic deployment approach, and (3) an evaluation/testing workflow…”
E6 (fear persona): “...professionals/managers who fear AI displacement and want practical workflow automation skills.”
E7 (ROI persona): “...who want ROI-focused AI systems (cost down / throughput up).”
E8 (credibility): “Instructor is a senior AI leader building real systems (not just theory)… ‘teaches what he builds.’”
E9 (in-person advantage): “Make in-person the advantage: accountability, hands-on help, peers, shipped outcome.”

4) SOLVE
Using only E1–E9, generate 5 one-liners per category:
* Fear-driven draws from E1, E6, E3 (anxiety/displacement → practical building).
* Ambition-driven draws from E5, E3 (curiosity → built/deployed agent).
* ROI-driven draws from E7, E5 (unclear ROI → deploy + evaluate).
* Community-driven draws from E4, E9 (solo/online → pods/peers/accountability).
* Credibility-driven draws from E8, E5 (theory/tutorials → real systems + deploy/test).
Confidence (0.0–1.0):
* Transformations identified: 0.95 (explicit in E3–E5, E7–E9)
* Category fit without over-claiming: 0.90 (some phrasing is interpretive but stays within scope)
* Word-count + format compliance: 0.98 (easy to verify)

5) VERIFY
Checks:
* All 25 lines begin with “In one weekend, you go from” and include “to”.
* Each line stays under 14 words.
* Claims stay within: hands-on, build an agent, deployment approach, evaluation/testing, pods, support, ROI framing, senior-led credibility.
* No job guarantees, no hype, no promises that exceed E1–E9.
No contradictions found.

Brand Foundation (bullets)
Core audience problem (what they’re stuck on)
* They can demo AI, but can’t reliably build + deploy a real agent that survives real workflows.
* Too many moving parts (tools, memory, retrieval, evals, guardrails) → decision paralysis.
* They don’t know what “good” looks like in practice: what to build, what to skip, what breaks in production.
* They lack fast feedback loops: no one to troubleshoot with, pressure-test choices, and ship something concrete.
Promise / outcome (what changes after 2 days)
* You leave with a deployed AI agent that does real work (not a toy prompt).
* You gain a repeatable build pattern for agentic workflows (so you can ship the next one faster).
* You learn the “minimum viable production” moves: tool use, reliability checks, and deployment basics.
* You walk out able to speak credibly about agents with teams/stakeholders—because you built one.
Key differentiators (vs online courses / generic workshops)
* Ship-first format: the output is a running agent, not notes or slides.
* Hands-on all the way: learning happens inside the build, not around it.
* Practical constraints > theory: decisions are made with real tradeoffs (reliability, scope, failure modes).
* In-person momentum: you move faster because you’re building with real-time support + peer pressure (the good kind).
Brand personality (3–5 adjectives)
* Builder-first
* Practical
* Sharp
* Confident
* High-signal
We are / We are not

Table C — Brand Voice Rules (Do / Don’t + examples)
DO (rules)	DON’T (rules)	Example line (show what “DO” looks like)
Lead with the shipped outcome.	Lead with big claims about “the future.”	“You’ll deploy an agent by day two.”
Use concrete verbs: build, ship, deploy.	Use vague verbs: learn, explore, discover.	“Build the workflow. Wire the tools. Deploy.”
Keep it tight—short sentences win.	Write long, abstract paragraphs.	“Two days. Hands on. Real output.”
Name the tradeoffs (scope, reliability).	Pretend everything is easy or automatic.	“We’ll show where agents break—and how to patch it.”
Be confidently opinionated (with reasons).	Be hype-y or apologetic.	“Demos aren’t the goal. Deployment is.”
Speak to professionals, not students.	Sound like a school or certification program.	“Bring your work reality. We’ll build inside it.”
Use modern technical terms sparingly, precisely.	Stack jargon until it’s unreadable.	“Tools + evals + guardrails—only what you’ll actually use.”
Make the room feel active and real.	Make it feel like a lecture hall.	“You’ll be building most of the time.”
Show proof through artifacts (deploy, demo).	Rely on superlatives (“best,” “world-class”).	“You leave with a deployed agent + a repeatable pattern.”
Respect skepticism; earn trust.	Overpromise “production-ready for everyone.”	“You’ll ship a solid v1—and know what to harden next.”

Table D — Positioning by Persona
Persona	Positioning statement (1 sentence)	30-sec pitch (2–4 sentences)	3 message pillars (bulleted in-cell)	Objections & responses (2 pairs, bulleted in-cell)
[PM_ADVANCED]	For advanced PMs who need to turn AI ideas into shippable agent features, AgentForge is the 2-day in-person build-and-deploy workshop that teaches the patterns to ship reliably, unlike online prompt courses, because you leave with a deployed agent and a product-grade playbook for scope, risk, and iteration.	You’re already past “what is an LLM.” You need to know what actually ships: where agents add leverage, how they fail, and what to build first. In two days, you build and deploy a real agent, then translate that build into product decisions—scope, guardrails, and what “v1” should be.	• From concept to feature shape — turn fuzzy “agent ideas” into a buildable slice
• Reliability mindset — common failure modes + practical guardrails (not hand-waving)
• Stakeholder-ready clarity — leave able to explain tradeoffs and next steps	• Objection: “I don’t need to code—I need product strategy.”
Response: “This is strategy through building: you’ll make the real decisions that determine scope, UX, and risk.”
• Objection: “Two days can’t be ‘production.’”
Response: “Correct—we ship a real v1 and the hardening checklist so you know exactly what comes next.”
[WORKING_PRO]	For working pros who want to automate a real workflow with an AI agent, AgentForge is the hands-on, in-person build sprint that gets you from curiosity to a deployed agent you can actually use, unlike piecemeal tutorials, because the workshop is designed around practical building, deployment, and repeatable patterns.	You don’t need more content—you need a working result. In two days, you build and deploy an agent that handles a real workflow (ops, analysis, marketing, internal support—wherever you live). You leave with something you can run, show, and iterate—plus the confidence to build the next one.	• Usable output — a deployed agent, not notes
• Workflow-first — start from the job, then choose the right agent pattern
• Confidence through reps — you’ll understand what you’re doing, not just copy-paste	• Objection: “I’m not technical enough.”
Response: “You don’t need to be an engineer—you need a clear workflow and willingness to build. The process is guided and practical.”
• Objection: “Will this work for my job/context?”
Response: “Agents are patterns. You’ll learn the pattern, then map it to your workflow—with a deployable outcome.”
[FOUNDER]	For founders/operators who need to ship agent-powered leverage fast, AgentForge is the 2-day agent build-and-deploy sprint that produces a sellable or demoable agent MVP, unlike weeks of tinkering or contractor handoffs, because you build the core agent loop yourself and leave with a deployed asset and a path to customer value.	If you’re building with agents, speed matters—but so does shipping the right slice. In two days, you ship an agent MVP you can demo, test with customers, or use internally immediately. You’ll make the key calls (scope, tooling, reliability) in the room, so you’re not outsourcing the brain of your product.	• MVP that moves the business — ship the smallest agent that creates value
• Founder control — you understand the build so you can iterate weekly
• Deployment mindset — don’t stop at “it works on my laptop”	• Objection: “I can just hire someone to build this.”
Response: “You can—but if you can’t judge or iterate it, you’ll stay dependent. This gives you founder-level control.”
• Objection: “Workshops are a distraction from shipping.”
Response: “This is shipping: two days to a deployed MVP, plus the decisions you’d otherwise learn the hard way.”
Quality Check (bullets)
* Names that may be too generic/confusing
    * AgentStudio, ShipLab, The Shipyard can undersignal “AI agent workshop.”
        * Fix: always pair with a strong descriptor: “2-day Agent Build Sprint” or “Build + Deploy Workshop.”
        * Fix: add “Agent” explicitly where needed (e.g., “Agent ShipLab” or “Agent Shipyard”).
    * AgentOps may collide with existing “AgentOps” usage in the market.
        * Fix: keep it as a program name (“AgentOps Track”) rather than the parent brand.
        * Fix: adjust to a less claimed structure (e.g., “Ops-to-Agent” or “AgentOps Sprint”).
* Taglines that risk cliché
    * “Build it. Deploy it. Demo it.” is punchy but structurally common.
        * Fix: sharpen with specificity: “Build one agent. Deploy it live.”
        * Fix: make it more anti-fluff: “Demo isn’t done. Deploy is.”
* Positioning statements that could be sharper
    * PM statement risks sounding like “learn patterns” without enough edge.
        * Fix: explicitly contrast against “prototype theater” and emphasize product-grade decisions (scope, risk, rollout).
    * Working pro statement risks feeling broad (“any workflow”).
        * Fix: anchor examples lightly in copy (ops reporting, customer support triage, research pipeline) without overpromising universality.

* ≥80% of attendees successfully build and demo a working agent by end of Day 2.
Proof capture
* 10 video testimonials
* 20 written quotes
* 20–30 attendee LinkedIn posts
* Footage for 10–20 short clips
* Build a waitlist for Cohort #2 immediately after Event #1.

Tone guardrails (from brief)
* Premium, practical, outcome-first.
* No hype. No “get rich quick.” No job/income guarantees.
* Address AI anxiety ethically: “stay relevant / work faster / lead adoption” without fearmongering.
* Make in-person the advantage: accountability, hands-on help, peers, shipped outcome.
* Credibility: concise, verifiable proof points; “teaches what he builds.”
* Employer reimbursement: say “many employers reimburse professional development” (don’t claim all do).

Persona choice for Event #1
Selected: Option A (Advanced) — Tech product managers / operators who want to become “AI-ready” and ship agentic features internally.
Justification (grounded in brief)
* Best alignment with a hands-on build format that still isn’t “engineers only.” PMs/operators can work in pods and ship a meaningful prototype.
* Strong fit for premium pricing + corporate reimbursement (“many employers reimburse…”).
* Warm outreach is most feasible here: founders’ networks + local tech community density.
* Higher probability of hitting ≥80% build-and-demo without making the workshop feel remedial.
Assumptions (explicit)
* Attendees are comfortable with basic technical tools (copy/paste code, terminal setup, API keys, following a repo).
* Curriculum provides scaffolding/templates so non-engineer PMs/operators can still ship a working agent.
* The workshop stack will be communicated clearly in prework (even if flexible).
Tradeoffs of not choosing the other two (for Event #1)
Not choosing Option B (Broader working professionals/managers)
* Tradeoff: Larger total addressable market.
* Why avoid now: Mixed skill levels increases the risk of disappointment and may threaten the 80% build success metric; more “intro to basics” time reduces “premium build weekend” feel.
Not choosing Option C (Founder/owner ROI systems)
* Tradeoff: Potentially higher willingness to pay and higher LTV.
* Why avoid now: Founders may expect bespoke ROI/consulting outcomes, or prefer strategy over hands-on building. Greater variance in goals can dilute the “everyone ships an agent” promise.

WHAT YOU’LL LEAVE WITH (Outcomes)
By Sunday afternoon, you’ll leave with:
1. A working AI agent you builtNot a demo video—your own project running on your laptop, tested and shown live.
2. A basic deployment approachEnough structure to move from “local prototype” → “something your team can run.”
3. An evaluation/testing workflowPractical evaluation concepts (including RAG-style evaluation thinking) so you can iterate with confidence.
Bonus: A repeatable build pattern you can use for your next agentic feature.

WHO IT’S FOR / NOT FOR (Persona clarity)
This is for you if you are a…
* Product Manager, Product Ops, Biz Ops, Growth/RevOps, Solutions/Implementation, Technical Program Manager
* Responsible (or soon to be responsible) for shipping AI features or workflow automation
* Comfortable learning by doing—even if you’re not a full-time engineer
* Tired of AI hype and want a structured build experience with real support
This is NOT for you if…
* You want a lecture, not a build
* You won’t bring a laptop or do prework
* You want guaranteed job outcomes or “get rich quick” promises
* You’re expecting bespoke consulting for your company (this is a workshop, not a consulting engagement)

AGENDA SNAPSHOT (12 hours / 2 days)
Day 1 (Build the core agent)
* Agent fundamentals: what makes “agentic” work in practice
* Picking a tight use case (so you actually finish)
* Tools + workflows: prompts, tool use, data, guardrails
* Pod build sprint: get a working v1 by end of day
Day 2 (Make it real + test + deploy)
* Add retrieval/data (where useful)
* Evaluation/testing workflow: what to measure, how to iterate
* Basic deployment approach + handoff notes
* Demos + feedback + next steps
You’ll spend the majority of time building in pods (3–4 people), with guided check-ins and support.

HOW IT WORKS (What makes in-person worth it)
Premium, organized, outcomes-first.
* Pods of 3–4 so you’re never stuck alone
* Short teaching blocks, then guided build time
* Support for setup, debugging, and scope control
* A clear run-of-show so you always know what “done” looks like
* Simple catering (no alcohol)
Expectation: You’ll do light prework so we can spend the weekend building—not troubleshooting basics.

PROOF (Credibility without bragging)
Instructor: Adil (senior AI leader building real systems)What matters: He teaches what he builds.

FAQ
How technical do I need to be?You don’t need to be a full-time engineer. You do need to be comfortable following technical setup steps, working from templates, and learning by doing. Pods and support are built in.
What will I actually build?A working AI agent with a clear use case (often internal workflow automation or a product feature prototype), plus a basic deployment approach and evaluation workflow.
Do I need an idea before I come?Helpful, not required. We provide a short list of proven project prompts and we’ll help you scope it so you finish.
Will you cover RAG?We’ll cover retrieval/data patterns where they’re useful, and how to evaluate them in a practical way.
Will I get a certificate?Optional. If you want a completion document for reimbursement, we can provide one (non-accredited).
Is food included?Simple catering is included (coffee/tea + lunch). No alcohol.
Can my employer pay?Yes—if you need an invoice with specific details, we can provide it. Many employers reimburse professional development.
Can I transfer my ticket?Yes—transfer policy details go in the refund/transfer section below.

REFUND / TRANSFER POLICY (placeholder)
Placeholder — confirm final terms.Suggested premium-friendly policy:
* Full refund up to 14 days before the event
* Transfer to another person anytime up to 48 hours before
* Within 14 days: credit toward a future cohort (no cash refund), unless event is canceled

VENUE (placeholder)

FINAL CTA (restate outcomes)
If you want to stop “reading about agents” and actually ship one—this is the weekend.
Reserve your seat (deposit) → [CHECKOUT LINK]Seats are limited to keep the experience hands-on.

(Optional) Landing page positioning variants for Personas B + C
Use these only if you ever run separate cohorts. Don’t mix in Event #1.
Option B variant (Broader professional, anti-anxiety without fearmongering)
* Hero angle: “Turn AI anxiety into a working workflow system in 2 days.”
* Outcomes: “Automate one real workflow, learn repeatable patterns, leave with a system you can use Monday.”
* “Not for you”: “If you want a magic tool that fixes everything.”
Option C variant (Founder/owner ROI systems)
* Hero angle: “Build one ROI-focused AI system in 2 days (cost down / throughput up).”
* Outcomes: “A working internal system + deployment plan + evaluation method for reliability.”
* “Not for you”: “If you want consulting or a fully custom build done for you.”

2) Outreach sequences (LinkedIn + email) + objection handling
Assumptions for outreach
* No paid ads; all seat-fill comes from warm network, targeted outbound, and partner/community intros.
* Primary conversion action: deposit/payment collected (not “interested”).

LinkedIn DM sequence (3 touches)
Tip: Keep it human and short. Don’t send a link until they signal interest (reduces spam flags).Optional connection note (before Touch 1):“Hey [Name] — I’m running a small in-person AI agent build weekend in Toronto for PMs/operators. Thought it might be relevant to your work at [Company]. Open to connecting?”
Touch 1 (after connect or if already connected)
Message:Hey [Name] — quick one. I’m helping run a small, premium AI Agent Build Weekend in Toronto for PMs/operators.
It’s a 2-day hands-on build: pods of 3–4 + support. Goal is you leave with a working agent, a basic deployment approach, and an evaluation workflow.
If you’re shipping (or planning) agentic features at [Company], want me to send the details + the network code?
Touch 2 (2–3 days later)
Message:Bumping this in case it got buried — we’re keeping it to ~30–50 seats so it stays hands-on.
If you want in, I can send:
* agenda snapshot
* who it’s for / not for
* pricing + network code
* deposit link (seat is only held once paid)
Want it?
Touch 3 (final nudge, 4–6 days later)
Message:Last ping — I’m closing the first batch of seats soon so we can finalize pods + support ratios.
If it’s not for you, no worries. If you have 1 person on your team who should become “AI-ready” this quarter, I can send the info for them.

Email sequence (3 touches)
Email 1 (initial)
Subject options (pick 1):
* “Toronto: build a working AI agent in a weekend (in-person)”
* “Hands-on AI agent build weekend (PM/operator cohort)”
* “In-person > online: ship an agent in 2 days”
Body:Hi [Name],I’m reaching out because you’re close to the work: shipping product features and operational systems.
We’re running a small, premium AI Agent Build Weekend in downtown Toronto: Sat + Sun, ~12 hours total. The format is short teaching blocks → pods of 3–4 → guided build time with support.
Outcome by end of Day 2
* a working AI agent you built
* a basic deployment approach
* an evaluation/testing workflow (including practical RAG-style evaluation concepts)
Pricing (premium): 1,500 [CURRENCY] list, with a 500 [CURRENCY] network code (1,000 [CURRENCY]). Many employers reimburse professional development; we provide a proper invoice/receipt.
If you want the details + network code, reply “send it” and I’ll share the page + deposit link.Best,[Mo / Name][Title][Phone optional]
Email 2 (follow-up, 2–3 business days later)
Subject: “Re: Toronto AI agent build weekend”
Hi [Name] — quick follow-up. We’re limiting seats to keep it hands-on (pods + support).
If you’re exploring agentic features this quarter, this is designed to move you from “curious” → “shipped prototype” fast.
Reply “send it” and I’ll forward the details + network code + deposit link.— [Name]
Email 3 (final, 4–6 business days later)
Subject: “Should I close the loop?”
Hi [Name] — should I close the loop on this?
If it’s not the right time, no problem. If you have someone on your team who should become AI-ready (PM/ops/TPM), I can forward the details for them.
— [Name]

Objection handling bank (12+)
Use this structure: Acknowledge → clarify → offer next step.
1. “I can learn this online.”Totally. This is for people who want the in-person advantage: accountability, hands-on help, pods, and leaving with something working. If you’re self-paced and consistent, online can be great.
2. “I’m not technical enough.”You don’t need to be a full-time engineer. You do need to be comfortable following setup steps and working from templates. If you can handle basic tooling with guidance, you’ll be fine—pods and support are built in.
3. “Too expensive.”It’s priced as a premium, small-cohort build experience with support. Many employers reimburse professional development—we provide an invoice/receipt and agenda. If budget is tight, the network code reduces it by 500.
4. “I need manager approval.”Makes sense. I can send a one-page summary (outcomes, agenda, price, reimbursement language) you can forward. If helpful, we can also issue an invoice addressed to your company.
5. “I don’t have time for 2 full days.”Understood. The value is in shipping a working agent with support. If you can’t commit to both days, it will feel incomplete.
6. “I don’t know what to build.”That’s common. We provide project prompts and help you scope it to something finishable. The goal is done, not “perfect.”
7. “I’m worried it’ll be hype.”Same. The workshop is outcome-first: build, test, deploy basics. No job promises, no hype—just a structured build.
8. “What if I get stuck?”That’s exactly why it’s in-person. Pods + support + checkpoints reduce the risk of being blocked for hours.
9. “We have security/privacy constraints.”Reasonable. You can build with non-sensitive sample data. We’ll focus on patterns you can later adapt internally.
10. “I’m an engineer—will this be too basic?”This cohort is optimized for PMs/operators who want to ship. Engineers are welcome if they’re aligned with the pace and collaborative pod format—but it’s not an advanced deep-dive engineering course.
11. “What if I can’t attend after paying?”We’ll publish a clear refund/transfer policy. Typically: refunds up to a cutoff, transfers allowed, and credit for future cohorts.
12. “Why pods? I prefer working solo.”Pods reduce failure rates and speed up debugging. You’ll still own your build, but you won’t be stuck alone.
13. “Is it CAD or USD?”Currency will be confirmed before checkout. Since it’s Toronto-based, CAD is likely—but we’ll make it explicit on the payment page.
14. “Will there be recruiting/job placement?”No. This is skills + outcomes-focused. The benefit is becoming more effective and AI-ready in your current role (or next one) without promises.

3) Referral / ambassador program (manual, simple)
Program name (simple + premium)
Founding Cohort Network Codes
Goal
Fill Event #1 without ads via trusted recommendations while keeping the experience premium.
Rules (copy/paste)
* Each ambassador gets a unique network code (e.g., AISPRINT-MAYA).
* Their code gives 500 [CURRENCY] off (1,500 → 1,000).
* A referral counts only when the attendee pays the deposit/full amount (not “interested”).
* Rewards are paid after the event (or after the refund window) to avoid admin churn.
* Ambassadors should only share with people who fit: PMs/operators who will do prework and build.
Tracking (manual)
* Create a simple sheet with columns: Code | Ambassador | Referred attendee | Paid? | Amount | Reward owed | Paid out date
* Checkout requires entering the code (or attendee can email Mo with the code used).
Reward options (pick 1–2; keep it clean)
Option 1: Credit (cleanest)
* 200 [CURRENCY] credit per paid seat toward a future cohort (or toward bringing a teammate).
Option 2: Cash-equivalent
* 150 [CURRENCY] gift card per paid seat (paid after Event #1).
Option 3: Give-back (fits “no alcohol” vibe; optional)
* Donate 150 [CURRENCY] per seat to a charity the ambassador chooses (with receipt shared).
Keep rewards modest to stay premium and avoid affiliate-marketing vibes.

Scaling plan toward late May 2026 (expected / to confirm)
* Run Event #1 (pilot) → lock proof assets + refine playbook
* Run Cohort #2 within ~4–6 weeks (same format, improved templates)
* Run Cohort #3 in the lead-up to late May (timed to the broader Toronto tech moment)
* Optional “larger presence” elements later (only after repeatable success):
    * larger venue
    * sponsor/partner bundles
    * additional support staff
    * a “showcase night” add-on(Do not add until deposits validate demand.)

Final: Ops sanity checklist (Mo — week before)
Venue + AV
* Confirm venue access times (setup + teardown)
* Test Wi‑Fi with 20+ devices plan (or confirm network capacity)
* Confirm projector/screen + adapters + audio
* Print signage: check-in, agenda, “filming in progress” notice
* Room layout: pods of 3–4, power strips, clear aisles
Attendee comms
* Send final email: agenda, arrival instructions, prework link, what to bring
* Confirm dietary restrictions (simple)
* Provide reimbursement-friendly invoice/receipt on request
* Confirm refunds/transfers policy is clearly posted (even if minimal)
Materials
* Name tags + markers
* Pod worksheet printouts (or QR code to doc)
* Agenda poster / one-pager
* Spare chargers/adapters (as available)
* Sticky notes, sharpies, pens
Catering (no alcohol)
* Coffee/tea + water plan
* Lunch order confirmed + delivery time
* Snacks (optional, simple)
* Labels for dietary options
Content capture
* Shot list printed + assigned roles
* Consent flow ready (pre-event + on-site signage)
* Quiet corner for testimonials
* Mic/audio solution tested (even a basic lav mic)
* Upload workflow for footage (same day backup)
Workshop ops
* Check-in process: list of paid attendees, badge/names, welcome script
* Pod assignment plan (pre-assigned or quick matching)
* Timekeeping plan (who keeps schedule tight)
* “Help desk” system during build blocks (so support is organized)
* Contingency: backup slides, offline materials, Wi‑Fi fallback idea
Post-event
* Survey link scheduled to send within 2 hours after end
* Testimonial request email drafted
* Waitlist + Cohort #2 deposit link prepared (send within 72 hours)

If you want, I can also generate:
* a one-page “manager approval” PDF summary (outcomes + agenda + pricing + reimbursement language), and
* a “project prompt menu” list of 15 finishable agent ideas optimized for PM/operator roles (so the 80% demo target is easier to hit).
