# Headshots (Source + Processed)

Source files (raw exports, can be HEIC/HEIF, any aspect ratio):
- assets/headshots-source/aadil-headshot.jpg
- assets/headshots-source/abdur-headshot.jpg

Processed files (used by the website):
- public/speakers/aadil-headshot.jpg
- public/speakers/abdur-headshot.jpg

Guidelines for processed files:
- Format: JPG (sRGB)
- Crop: centered face, tight but not claustrophobic
- Size: >= 400x400 (square is ideal; we currently render circular avatars)
- File size: keep <= ~200KB if possible (optimize/compress)
