# Phase 2a — Canonical Offer Brief (Name, Persona, Promises, Guardrails)

## Focus
Convert the long, overlapping `Plans/plan.md` into a single canonical “offer brief” that the site, checkout, and admin are built around.

## Inputs
- `Plans/plan.md` (Context Brief is the authoritative section).
- Phase 2 constraints.

## Work
1. **Naming decision package (no design work):**
   - Working brand options from `Plans/plan.md`: “Normal Bots” (rights check), “Zero-to-Agent” (working title).
   - Output: pick one “public brand” and one “event/program name”, plus a one-line tagline.
   - If rights status is unknown, plan for a safe fallback (e.g., “Zero-to-Agent” as site repo name; “AI Agent Build Weekend” as public program name).
2. **Pick ONE primary persona for Event #1** (avoid mixed-level disappointment):
   - Option A (Advanced PM/operator), Option B (working professional), Option C (founder).
   - Output: “Target persona for this site” + secondary personas (if any) as “not for you” language.
3. **Lock the promise language (safe, credible):**
   - Outcome promise must match: working agent + basic deployment + eval/testing workflow.
   - Avoid absolute guarantees; use “designed for ≥80% to demo by Sunday” language only if we also include prerequisites and prework.
4. **Guardrails for claims + tone:**
   - No job/income guarantees.
   - Ethical framing around AI anxiety.
   - Premium, calm, practical.
5. **Operational constraints that affect the site:**
   - Toronto venue + dates TBD; keep copy structured for “date/venue announced soon” if needed.
   - “No alcohol”, “pods of 3–4”, “hands-on keyboard” are required differentiators.
6. Produce an “Offer Brief” artifact outline to be placed into code later (e.g., `content/offer.ts`):
   - Name/tagline, persona, promise, format, agenda-level bullets, pricing + network code, refund/deposit stance, proof capture expectations.

## Output
- A single canonical offer brief (as a structured outline) with all ambiguous items explicitly marked “TBD” and their owner (Adil vs Mo).

## Handoff
Pass the finalized brief to Phase 2b so IA and copy are written to match the chosen persona and promise language.
