# Phase 2b — Single-Page IA + Section Copy Spec (Anchored)

## Focus
Define the `/` single-page structure, anchor nav, and per-section copy/asset requirements based on the canonical offer brief.

## Inputs
- Phase 2a canonical offer brief (persona, naming, promises).
- Reference motifs (TKS-style anchor nav + marquee; Refunnel polish).

## Work
1. Finalize anchors and section order (single page):
   - `#top`, `#why`, `#outcomes`, `#how`, `#agenda`, `#pricing`, `#faq`, `#apply`
2. For each section, specify:
   - Primary headline + subhead (1–2 variants)
   - Bullets (3–6)
   - Supporting media requirements (video, icon set, photos, testimonial placeholders)
   - CTA label and destination
3. Include explicit “in-person advantage” language throughout:
   - accountability, hands-on help, peers/pods, shipped outcome
4. Pricing section requirements:
   - list price vs network code price
   - currency disclaimer (CAD vs USD) + invoice/receipt support wording
5. Referral program mention (optional, tone-safe):
   - A discreet line near pricing or apply confirmation (avoid “coupon vibes”)
6. Create a “FAQ requirements list”:
   - Use the 20 objection/answers set in `Plans/plan.md` as raw source; select the best 8–12 for the site.

## Output
- Decision-complete IA + section copy/asset spec that maps directly to implementation components.

## Handoff
Hand off the section spec to Phase 2c so motion is designed around the real page structure (no later reshuffles).
