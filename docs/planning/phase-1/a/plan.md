# Phase 1a — Narrative Arc + Single-Page IA (Content Map)

## Focus
Define the **single-page** information architecture and the narrative arc for the adult “escape the rat race with agentic dev skills” offer, while mapping the best structural beats from TKS/Refunnel into **original** sections/copy.

## Inputs
- Reference captures (local):
  - `/tmp/site-analysis/screenshots/*`
  - `/tmp/site-analysis/data/tks.json`
  - `/tmp/site-analysis/data/refunnel.json`
  - Motion board video: `/tmp/site-analysis/videos/compare/*.webm`
- Project constraints from Phase 1 root plan.
- `Plans/plan.md` (currently empty; needs consolidation content to be added by the user or re-sourced from chats).

## Work
1. Extract and list the “beats” we are copying as principles:
   - TKS-style: hero media + oversized headline, marquee/ticker, anchor nav, punchy section sequencing
   - Refunnel-style: pill header polish, card-based explanation blocks, clean spacing, refined CTA styling
2. Produce a decision-complete **section order** and **anchor map** for `/`:
   - `#top`, `#about`, `#roadmap`, `#curriculum`, `#proof`, `#faq`, `#apply`
3. Write a content specification for each section:
   - headline, subhead, bullets, CTAs, supporting media needs
   - what is “required v1” vs “optional v2”
4. Define copy tone and messaging rules:
   - target persona, promises, proof expectations, and disallowed claims
5. Identify open content gaps that must come from the user:
   - program name, duration, pricing (if any), cohort size, start dates, guarantees, key differentiators
6. Provide a migration path from the messy/consolidated plan doc:
   - when `Plans/plan.md` is populated, map its items into: Roadmap steps, Curriculum modules, FAQ, Proof.

## Output
- A finalized single-page IA + content map (ready to encode into a typed content file later, e.g. `content/site.ts`).
- A list of required assets (video/illustrations/logos/testimonials) with placeholders.
- A short set of “copy guardrails” and “must-avoid” items to keep messaging consistent and compliant.

## Handoff
Deliver the section list + content map to Phase 1b so layout scaffolding and component boundaries are locked before motion work begins.
