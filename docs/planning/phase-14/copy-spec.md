## `#who`
- Heading:
  - `Who this is for`
- Intro:
  - `Best fit: teams with repeatable, multi-step work spread across too many tools.`
- Bullets:
  - `Operations leaders who want fewer manual handoffs`
  - `Sales + RevOps teams who want cleaner pipelines and faster follow-up`
  - `Customer support and CS Ops teams who need actions, not just answers`
  - `Finance Ops teams doing reporting, reconciliations, approvals`
  - `Procurement and supply chain teams handling exceptions and vendor workflows`
- Qualification line:
  - `If work is stuck in spreadsheets, inboxes, and back-and-forth across systems, this is likely a fit.`

## `#what`
- Heading:
  - `What we implement`
- Intro:
  - `We build agentic workflows that act inside your existing systems, then continuously improve them.`
- Offer blocks:
  - `Workflow mapping: we identify the highest-value operational bottlenecks first.`
  - `Implementation: we deploy workflows directly in your current tooling stack (no rip-and-replace).`
  - `Enablement: your team gets hands-on training and SOP-level documentation.`
  - `Ongoing improvement: monthly optimization, monitoring, and expansion to new workflows.`
- Concrete example list:
  - `CRM hygiene + follow-up tasks that don’t slip`
  - `Support triage + back-office actions`
  - `Reporting and exception alerts across systems`
  - `Quote and document workflows with approvals`

    - `Live workflow assessment on your systems`
    - `Bottleneck audit (where margin/time is leaking)`
    - `Prioritized automation roadmap`
    - `Implementation recommendation`
  - Risk reversal line:
    - `100% refund if you aren't satisfied`
  - Clarifier:
    - `Applies to the Discovery Workshop.`
  - CTA: `Start with Discovery`
- Pricing footnote:
  - `Final scope and quote are set after discovery based on workflow complexity and team capacity.`

## `#faq`
- Q1:
  - `What happens after deployment?`
  - `We continue to manage and improve the workflows. You get monthly optimization, maintenance, and training so the system keeps getting better instead of collecting dust.`
- Q2:
  - `What do you mean by “managed”?`
  - `We handle deployment, monitoring, and improvements. You get a backlog and a monthly ship cadence, so value increases after launch rather than stopping at go-live.`
- Q3:
  - `Do we need a technical team to use this?`
  - `No. We design for operators and non-technical teams. We handle implementation and give your team practical operating procedures.`
- Q4:
  - `How do we start?`
  - `Most teams start with the Discovery Workshop, then choose either an Implementation Sprint or an ongoing partnership.`
- Q5:
  - `Who owns the workflows and process docs?`
  - `You do. We provide documentation and training as part of delivery.`
- Q6:
  - `What do you need from us?`
  - `A point of contact, access to the tools involved, and feedback during demos. We do the implementation work.`
- Q7:
  - `Is this a platform purchase?`
  - `No. It’s an implementation and operating partnership. We build the workflows and keep them improving after launch.`

## `#contact`
- Heading:
  - `Let's scope your first workflow`
- Supporting line:
  - `Share your bottlenecks and we will map the fastest path to measurable operational gains.`
- CTA:
  - Label: `Book a call`
  - Target: `NEXT_PUBLIC_BUSINESS_CALENDLY_URL` or fallback `#contact` when missing
- Secondary contact line:
  - `Prefer email? hello@zerotoagent.com`

## Home page refinement spec (`/`)

## `#vision`
- Heading:
  - `Our vision`
- Body:
  - `AI should feel usable on day one. We help individuals and teams move from confusion to practical execution with clear workflows, plain language, and measurable outcomes.`

## `#programs`
- Section title:
  - `Choose your path`
- Card 1:
  - Label: `For Individuals`
  - Copy: `Learn to build and deploy your own agent workflows in a focused, hands-on format.`
  - CTA: `Explore Individuals`
  - Link: `/individuals`
- Card 2:
  - Label: `For Businesses`
  - Copy: `Get managed implementation and ongoing optimization for high-impact operational workflows.`
  - CTA: `Explore Businesses`
  - Link: `/businesses`

## `#principles`
- Heading:
  - `How we work`
- Principles:
  - `Abstract complexity: we hide technical overhead so teams can focus on outcomes.`
  - `Post-deploy value matters: deployment is the start, not the finish line.`
  - `Pragmatic demos beat theory: we lead with real workflows and measurable use cases.`
  - `Plain language first: if it is not understandable to a non-technical operator, we simplify it.`
