    OR DESCRIBED. IN FACT, THERE ARE FREQUENTLY SHARP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN
    HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND THE ACTUAL RESULTS SUBSEQUENTLY
    ACHIEVED BY ANY PARTICULAR BUSINESS. ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF HYPOTHETICAL
    PERFORMANCE RESULTS IS THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PREPARED WITH THE BENEFIT
    OF HINDSIGHT. IN ADDITION, HYPOTHETICAL BUSINESS DOES NOT INVOLVE FINANCIAL
    RISK, AND NO HYPOTHETICAL BUSINESS RECORD CAN COMPLETELY ACCOUNT FOR
    THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER RISK IN ACTUAL BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE
    ABILITY TO WITHSTAND LOSSES OR TO ADHERE TO A PARTICULAR BUSINESS STRATEGY
    IN SPITE OF BUSINESS LOSSES ARE MATERIAL POINTS WHICH CAN ALSO ADVERSELY
    AFFECT ACTUAL BUSINESS RESULTS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER FACTORS RELATED
    TO THE MARKETS IN GENERAL OR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY SPECIFIC BUSINESS
    PROGRAM, WHICH CANNOT BE FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PREPARATION OF
    HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE. When used herein, this "book" means this book, its contents,

     First, congratulations. You re officially part of the ACQ sales team. That's no small
accomplishment. Just so you know, thousands of people apply each year and only a
select few make the cut. That makes you one of the select few.
                                                             J




    This handbook breaks down winning into clear definitions and actions meant
specifically for you. By the time you finish it, you will know what winning really means.
And more than that, how to do it.



       This handbook has one purpose: To shortcut your success.
    When I first started selling I had no clue what I was doing. I just needed to survive.
And bit by bit I started getting it. Fast forward to now and I've personally closed more
than 4,000 one-on-one sales. But, it took me over 10 years to really figure it out.

    Nobody on this team can afford to take 10 years to figure it out. For that reason, I
owe you every drop of wisdom I have. In this handbook I turn my 10-year struggle into
your six-month Rocky training montage ... or less.



       This handbook makes one promise: A lffetime of dividends.

       I held this handbook to one simple standard: "If I could go back and talk to myself
when I had nothing, what would I say?"
     Everything in this handbook is the answer to that question. As I poured my many
years of lessons into these pages, one thing became clear-this is the handbook I wish I
had.
       If you live by these lessons, frameworks, and tactics, they will pay dividends for the
rest ofyour life.

     This isn't a book made to look pretty on a shelf. It is a handbook for a reason. I made
it for you to keep in hand. I expect to see this on your desk, spine broken and pages
tattered- from use.

     This is your weapon. Your toolkit. Your blueprint for winning. And I break it down
into the following sections:

    •    Welcome to the Jungle (You just read it) .

    •    How to Use This Handbook (You're reading it right now) .

    •    What is Selling? What sales is and why most people get it wrong.

    •    ACQ Sales Career Path: Your roadmap from Jr SDR to Director. Every level
         and path your sales career can take at ACQ.

         full-time contribution.

    •    On-Going Training & Schedule: How to get better every single day so you
         never plateau like 90% of salespeople.

    •    Hunt Mode: Generating opportunities, securing opportunities, and setting
         yourself up for the kill. You will spend a majority of your time hunting.

    •    Kill Mode: Closing sales. You will understand the intention and objective of
         each step to maximize your conversion.

    •    The Script Bank: The exact words to say on the phone and over text for every
         situation.

     •   Additional Resources: Links to the best videos on sales I've ever made. You

     If you execute everything in this handbook, you will become an expert at selling.
Easily in the top 1% or even the top .1 %. But, you cannot get there without first
understanding what selling is. And rather than only define it, I will set the frame with a
powerful story.


                                               ***

    An arrogant student interrupts a psychology seminar and scoffs:

     ''Look man, everyone knows you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink,"
acting as if he just shared some profound wisdom.

     The psychology professor paused and looked at the student. "That, "he said slowly,
"is the best way to make yourself powerless."

     The room fell silent.
     "You assume the environment doesn't matter. You assume we can change nothing
that affects whether the horse drinks. But you are wrong ... "

     He made his way to the blackboard, chalk in hand.
     "If you want the horse to drink"-he drew an arrow. "You could salt its feed the
night before ... "

    Another arrow. "... You could remove its access to water for a while ... "

    A third arrow. "... You could put water an inch from its mouth ... "

     A fourth arrow. "... and fix its head on it so it can't look away ... "

      1ou could even ... "-another arrow- "... start bl ee d'mg 1t

     The students got visibly uncomfortable.

     To become the best salesperson possible, you must know the
                                                              begin by defining impo;;an:

     First, selling means maximizing the likelihood a prospect buys.

   Second, a sales process arranges conditions to maximize
buys-(like how salty food makes drinking more likely).
                                                                     the likelih         ood aprospect
     Third, a salesperson goes through the sales process to maximize
buys.
                                                                    for as many prospects
     So if ideal selling increases the likelihood of buying to 100%
as possible, then the ideal salesperson has two objectives:

         So, first things first. To become a full-time closer, you must first become a full.
    time setter. Everyone starts as a setter for one reason: Ifyou can't set you can't close. It
    doesn't matter if you were the top guy in your last crew. Or you have the best close
    rate ever. I genuinely don't care. I'd rather have a kindergarten teacher that can do the
    basics well than a career closer that can't. If you can't do the basics well, you can't do the
    advanced stuff well. Because by my standards ... advanced stuff is just violent execution
    ofthe basics. So, you'll start as a setter. And when you can sustain high performance as a
    setter, I will qualify you to close.

        And now it's time to focus your attention on the image above. The image above
    shows a clear-cut career progression through the ACQ Sales Department. First, I need
    you to see just how many levels to sales there are. Second, I need you to see that you
    determine the speed of your progression. Only when you master the required skills and
    sustain high performance at your current level will I qualify you for the next.

        Once you've worked your way up the ranks and proven yourself as a Closer Manager,
    you open the door to four fantastic opportunities.

     I provide the tools, training, and resources. You bring the skills and effort.
     That's how we win. With that said, it's common for salespeople to think they are amazin
well before they are. So, it's best we set some expectations about how this progressio!
works in real life. Qualifying for the next level doesn't mean you automatically jump
there. Qualifying means it now makes sense for us to ask if you are undeniably ready for it.


Why Being Qualified Alone Isn't Enough
     First, your basic skills for the role you have will dramatically improve because we
will force you to improve them. You'll be amazed at how good you get when somebody
gives a damn that you get better.

     Then, you'll find a rhythm. You'll feel good. You'll set appointments. You'll close
prospects. You'll start feeling like you deserve a promotion.

     You are wrong.

     Hitting the performance standard is only one part of the equation. And it's the easier
part. To get to the next level you must sustain high performance. This is when the rrue

colors of a salesperson begin to show. If they are undisciplined. If they are emotional. If
they are inconsisteIH. This is where we see it.

     This is because being disciplined, controlling your emotions, and staying consistent
are easy when you see progress every day. But you go from getting better everyday to
getting better every week to getting better every month. This means the more progress you
make the slower progress gets. Everybody knows this. But what they forget is that the slower
progress gets the more difficult it is to stay disciplined. To control your emotions. And
to stay consistent. Seeing how discipline, emotional control, and consistency change as
progress slows down tells us everything we need to know. Let me explain how:

     Think about it like a baseball player: the performance of a .200 batter and a .300
batter look similar at any given time. But the more swings you watch, the bigger the
difference gets. And after 1,000 swings it gets painfully obvious that one batter is 50%
better. But that doesn't mean they net 50% more income, it might net them 500% more.
Once you're near the top, tiny changes get outsized results.

     The difference between good and great salespeople is the same. You can't really tell
the difference on any given call. But the more calls you compare, the more obvious it
gets. Good salespeople get on "hot streaks" and "cold streaks". Great salespeople never
get cold. And this is exactly why demonstrating high performance is not enough. The
real returns come when you can sustain high performance.

     And sustaining high performance only.comes from being disciplined, controlling
your emotions, and staying consistent. Day in and day out. You will learn to love the
repetitions. You will master the mundane. You won't have to "ride highs" because you
stay locked in all the time. You won't have to get out of ruts because you just won't fall
into them in the first place.

    This is how you unlock the opportunities, including the much higher tiers of
income, we have to offer. You have to become undeniable.

     But, he realized success meant more than just outworking everyone with the skills
he had. He realized he had to master new skills. The problem was dear. So rather than
shrivel and die- he asked for help. He knew feedback is fuel. In time, he learned that
becoming a master of sales isn't about getting enough kills. It's about mastering the art
of the kill. And that meant he had to kill for sport.

    He started preparing for tomorrow today.

    He stopped being cute.

    He did the boring work.

    He climbed back up to #1.

   And after holding the #1 spot again, I gave him another shot. But this time he knew
what he was up against. He prepared 1Ox better than before. And he succeeded.

    Months later he told me, "When I started, I felt like I knew it all. But the more
experience I get, the more I realize I don't know shit."

     This has become a running joke. When new guys see progress every day, they think
they are amazing. But then, it stops. And that's when the real learning starts. And if they
survive. They go from trying to win to winning by default. They go from doing it for
the promotion to doing it because winning is who they are.

    So if you get denied a promotion, it's simple-you were deniable. If you weren't, you
would've gotten it. And when you see the world that way you only have one choice-to
become undeniable.

    So if you're not sure what to do, remember: Outwork everyone because volume
negates luck. Prepare so much it's unreasonable to fail.

   In sales, violence is the answer-violent preparation, violent persistence, violent
commitment.

     Use every repetition to sharpen your sword. To get better.

     Use every rejection to make yourself more resilient. To sustain high performance.

     A bad lead is your chance to close a challenging prospect.

     A slump is your chance to climb to the top.

    I want you to win. For two reasons:

     1)     I want to leave everyone better than I found them.

     2)     When you win, I win too.

     I say this because . .. you cost me money to recruit. You cost me money to train. You
will cost me money in lost sales other closers could've gotten. But I am willing to make
this investment because I know you can win. And when you do, we win together.


                                                                      ***

     To maximize the chances of winning, you'll follow a proven onboarding process.

      Roleplay. Roleplaying is when you act out a sales conversation. One person plays
 the prospect and the other practices selling them. T he "prospect" gives you the same
 problems you1d get on real calls. Your job is to respond using the correct scripts and
 techniques. It is great practice. Roleplaying the ACQ way has flve steps:

     1)   Frame it: 1he manager explains what to practice, how to do it, and why.

     2)   Model it: Then, he will show you.
     3)   Copy it: Then, you will copy him.

     4)   Practice it: Then, you will roleplay until you get it.


               He will let you keep trying until you do it right. Expect lots of feedback.
               Do not get frustrated. Be grateful you get as many reps as you need to
               master it.

     5)   Recap it: Then he will recap the roleplay and move on to the next one.

    Tests. Before you start on the phones, you must pass three skill tests: Tone, Recaps,
and Objection Looping. Once you pass each test, you'll start going live with prospects.

    Shadowing. You will observe ACQ salespeople sell. You will learn how calls work,
hear live customers, and get to know the team.

    Gametape. This is where you study call recordings. You'll start specific, then expand
as you master the script. Have your script with you and sell along with the salesman.
This is not about just getting the words. To maximize the results, you muse also roleplay
it. Make sure you pause and rewacch hard parts until you nail it.

                            On-Going: Training


   Once you get your training wheels off, you'll start training with the crew. This is
what to expect:

    Daily Team Training: You will train 30 minutes per day with the team Mon-Fri.
This is on-site and remote. The agenda is as follows:

    1)    Shoutouts + Testimonials. Bring any nice things to share about your
          teammates. If you genuinely let somebody know they did a good job, they will
          keep it up. And the same goes for you. To get shoutouts, giving shoutouts is a
          good start. Performing at a level worthy of shoutouts is a better start. We also
          build conviction by sharing testimonials sent by happy customers sold by our
          team. Our selling makes a difference in people's lives-it's awesome.

    2)    Script Training. We train the closing script in four parts: Introduction,
          Discovery, Offer, and Looping. One per day. Every Friday, the manager trains
          you on a high leverage "hot topic". The schedule looks like this:

          MONDAY - INTRO

          TUESDAY - DISCOVERY

          WEDNESDAY - OFFER

          THURSDAY - LOOPING

          FRIDAY - HOT TOPIC

     3)   Roleplay. Roleplay doesn't stop after onboarding. After real-world experience,
          roleplay is the best training you can get. Like before, we:

           a)   Frame it: The manager explains what to do, how, and why.
           b)   Model it: Then, he will show you.
           c)   Copy it: Then, you will copy him.

    I see training and career advancement as one and the same. This is why I dedicate so
much of this workbook to breaking it down. First, you master the skills. And a big part
of mastering the skills is effectively teaching the skills. Second, you must sustain high
performance. Then, you advance-and we repeat the process.

     ACQ Closers do this in two modes: Hunt Mode and Kill Mode.



    Hunt Mode: Everything you do to get prospects on the phone. _This is where
you sharpen your tools, lay your snares, and track your targets. Huntmg maximizes
opportunities and increases conversion.
    Kill Mode: Everything you do while on the phone to get the sale. This is where
you bring the pain, make your offer, loop any objections, and go for the kill. Kill Mode
maximizes conversion and increases your opportunities.


     ACQ Closers arc either hunting or killing. Many organizations don't set their
salespeople up to win this way. And this is why you will beat them.

    Hunting is more important than killing because you can't do one without the other.
You can't take a shot without something to shoot. Hunt mode is what separates our team
from every other team.

# I Call Notes

   Call notes really increase conversion. If you know your prospect, then you know
what offer is best for them and how to prepare for any objections ahead of time.

    Call notes are a combined effort between setters and closers. Setters extract what
they can, and then closers fill whatever gaps they need to fill.

      You will update and review call notes the night before and the morning of your
calls. So get to the office early to update and review.

#2 Work Your List

     The bulk of your day is spent working your list. If you're not on a close call, then
you're getting prospects on close calls. This is the game.

    You work the prospects in the order they are most 1-ikely to buy. To make it simple,
we split them into three groups. Each is explained below.



    Priority 1: Inbound Sets. These are prospects who have booked an appointment
but have not spoken to a closer yet. These are your newest, freshest, and therefore
highest value appointments. If you get an inbound notification, call them immediately.

    Your objective is to pull the close call forward. Ideally, to right now. And if not now,
then later that day.

    Use the Inbound Set Phone Script and Inbound Set Text Script when working
Inbound Set prospects. Remember to double dial before you text.

   Tcxting Guidelines:
   Begin texting after you finish your Inbound Sets.
   When they text back, call them immediately.
   If they don't pick up, text them back.
   Handle objections over text by setting appts rather than typing out paragraphs.




   Team Training is Sacred
   You may not schedule calls during training. But, if an existing close call runs long, closing it
   takes priority. This is the only exception.




Working Inbound Sets: The Full Process

      The scripts for the BAMFAMs and Pipeline tell the story. But working Inbound Sets
is a little more involved. So, I put an image and process of our inbound workflow below:

        If a prospect texts back quickly Call them immediately
        If you get into an ongoing text conversation with a prospect, after 1-2 replies, and a "..." on
        their side, call them. They'll either pick up, and you can close, pull forward, or confirm them.
        Or, they'll text you back that they can't talk, and you can continue the conversation via text.
        But always go for the phone call if you can.

#3 Outbound

    You create your own opportunities by making outbound calls to set your own
appointments. First, you will do outbound after working your list. Second, you will do
outbound during Pickup Primetime.

    When Pickup Primetime occurs, you drop everything (except for a live call) to
do outbound for the next two hours. Pickup Primecime happens at the end of the day
because that's when our pick up rates are highest. This maximizes your return on time
and maximizes your opportunities. Outbound calls have two priorities:


    Outbound Priority 1: Getting Referrals. Referrals are customers that come from
our customers. You'll reach back out to customers for referrals when: 1) You closed a
prospect but ran out of time to ask for a referral. 2) Anyone who sends you a nice text
out of the blue.

     We want as many of these as possible. To gee the referrals, double-dial and text
current or previous customers, pay them a compliment, and ask for other people like
them. Use the Referral Script in the script bank. They are the best leads you can get. So
get them. Doing this should net you an extra deal a day.



    Outbound Priority 2: Opt-Ins. With the remainder of your outbound block, you
double dial and text unscheduled leads who opted into our marketing list--Jrom newest
to oldest.

    When calling opt-ins, use the Outbound Set Phone Script+ the Outbound No Pick
Up Text Script. Calling opt-ins should get you two sets per hour, so four total. Four secs
should get at least one close. Counting referrals, this means every closer should generate
two deals per day from outbound alone.

     Reminder: Any availability you have after working your list is dedicated to setting
your own appointments. The two hour block is the minimum. Winners do more than
this because they get even more deals. And if you want to win, you will too.

     Every qualified prospect is sellable if we control the conditions. Remember, every
condition increases the chance someone buys. Controlling any QJ1' condition increases
your chances some. Controlling all of them increases your chances a lot. Controlling all
of them, all the time, makes you unbeatable.

     We control these conditions with skill. And the skills aren't hard to understand.
The hard part is sustaining high performance--doing chem all, correcdy, every time, for
a long time.



Kill Skills
    We don't beat other sales teams because we do mysterious and magical things
nobody else knows. We beat other sales teams because we do obvious and logical things
nobody else does. So this is your chance to put yourself on the winning team and set
yourself apart.

    These are your Kill Skills:

    1)   Breathe the Script

    2)   Tone

    3)   Introduction

    4)   Discovery

    5)   Offer

    6)   Objections

    7)   Looping

                                         Don't Be Cute

     Many years ago, I got introduced to a big-time CEO that had exited four companies.
I had been waiting for this call for weeks. I asked for the introduction because I cooked
up some elaborate sales strategy and said I wanted some feedback. But really, I thought
it would impress him.

     A few minutes into the call he cuts me off-"You ever play backyard football?"

     " ... why?" I said.

    He grins, "Because you think you're all fancy with your double fake extra zesty QB
ghost play. But what actually happens when you cry chat play? You fumble the ball and
     .
turn It over.
              ,,

    He continued. "You need to run fundamental plays. Put the two fat guys up front
and run to the right. Consistent yardage. That's how you win."

     I sat in my chair, unsure what to say next. After the long pause, he said three words
that changed how I did business forever:

                                      "Don't be cute."

   See, most people think basic methods get basic results. This leads them to believe
complex methods get better results. So they make up these elaborate schemes and get . ..
no results.

    The basics are the basics for a reason. It means they work every time when executed
properly. If you do things that work every time, enough times, for a long enough time,
you wm.

    In backyard football it's putting the fat guys up front and running to the right.
    In sales it's breathing the script.

i~. Breathe it . Until you have dreams of saying the script, you have not ~one it enough
t im es. And remember, the script on its own means very little. But knowing th e script so
well you can recite it as naturally as breathing? That's the big money.

      Look at it this way.

      1)    If you can't remember what to say, you're not paying attention to the prospect.

      2)    If you then have to look for what to say, you're not paying attention to the
            prospect.

      3)    If you're reading what to say, you're .. . not paying attention to the prospect.

     If you're not paying attention to the prospect, then it doesn't matter how good of a
script you have-you'll say the wrong stuff.


                           If you say the wrong stuff, you will not close.

     Master closers know everything they need to say before they get on a call. And our
scripts take you massive steps in that direction.

      The script is gold. And I get so hard-nosed about breathing the script because it
 works. Breathing the script is how you become great. Breathing this script makes careers,
 feed s families, and builds legacies. You are not above the script. I am not above che
 script. Nobody is above the script. And that's because it came from the results of more calls
 than any s ingle closer could ever have in a lifetime.

    Important Note: Most people think "breathe the script" means "use similar words
in about the same order,,. This is wrong. You need to deliver the script word-for-word,
with your eyes closed, naturally. More sales are lost from people putting their own spin
on things. Getting cute instead of following the proven process. That's dumb. Do not
be dumb.

    Think about it like this. When somebody puts their own spin on it, they disrespect
tens of thousands of hours of hard work other salesmen did for them.•• because they
think they can do better. Those men did all that work to make sure you have the highest
chance of winning! Nobody is above the script. We put the time and resources into it so
you didn't have to. Take advantage of it.



     Knowing the right words is good. Great, even. But knowing the right words is
only part of the battle. Because the words, no matter how right they are, only make a
difference when said the right way...

                                               Tone



                                     Every Word Has a job to Do

         After memorizing the right words, the next step is saying them the right way. The
    script is what to say. Tone is how to say it.

         Tone is a touchy topic for sales guys everywhere for two reasons. First, they all
    agree it matters. Second, none of them really agree on why. This leads everyone through
    a forest of confusion, mysticism, and bullshit. And very few make it out. Now I don't
    care about confusing people with mystical bullshit. But I do care about closing deals. So
    tone, at least for me, serves one purpose. To:


                                -Make sure every word does its job-

        Tone gives a word its job. So if you change your tone then you change the word's
    job-wha t it means. This is good because if you make a word do the right job, it helps
    you. This is bad because if you make a word do the wrong job, it hurts you. This is
    important because if every word does the right job, then you use fewer of them. Think
    about it this way. A closer who takes fewer words to close a sale is more persuasive than
    a closer who takes more words to close a sale. You want to be a more persuasive closer.
    Plain and simple.

        Your script assigns a job to each word. Your tone makes sure the word does that job.
    So to make tone as simple and easy as possible, I break it down into two buckets. Stuff
    you keep the same, and stuff you change.

        Stuff that stays the same:

        •   How slow you talk: Prospects need to keep track of your words .

        •   How loud you talk: Prospects need to hear your words .

        •   How clear you talk: Prospects need to understand your words .

good track of what you're saying. You still lose the sale.
     Talking too fast is like fighting with one arm behind your back. Use both arms. The         1
ideal range is about 150-170 words per minute. Super easy to measure as an average.
This range makes you easy to follow and allows for some natural shifts in speed.

     Important: At this speed, it would take just over three minutes to read a 500-word
script straight through. Taking it a step further, if a call goes perfect on your side and
takes 15 minutes to close, then the prospect spoke for 12 minutes and you spoke for
three. Chew on that for a bit. You're probably talking too much.
    Talk Louder (Volume) - When you talk quietly, prospects can't hear you as well.
And if they can't hear you, they won't buy. Some people argue that if you talk quieter
then people will listen harder. And I agree, in-person. But let's play out what happens
over the phone:

     1)    They turn their phone volume up anyways. Pointless.

     2)    They can't hear you and ask you to repeat yourself. Ugly.
                                                                                .         ers

         The business owners aren't laying on the couch for a therapy session. They are here
    far business. They make it loud and clear. So should you. If I had to choose between
    guaranteeing a prospect hears my offer and not guaranteeing a prospect hears my offer•••
    I'd rather they heard my offer.

        Talk Clearer (Enunciation) - saying words correctly and distinctly. Each sound
    and syllable is clearly defined.


                                        -Crisp. And. Clear.-

        When you enunciate properly, it will:

        1)   Keep you talking at the right speed.

        2)   Display more confidence and intelligence than a mumbler.

        3)   Make you easier to understand.

        If you say the right words-and if you breathe the script, you will-then all these
    things make you more persuasive than ... not these things.



         Bottom Line: You are a more effective closer when you: slow down enough so
    prospects can track what you say, speak loud enough so they hear what you say, and
    enunciate so they can understand what you say. That's basic stuff. The constant yardage
    that wins games. And it's why those parts of tone never change-because clear beats
    clever every time.



    What Changes: Pitch and Pauses

         Getting Prospects to Talk (Pitch) - Highness or lowness ofyour voice. To clarify, we
    aren't singing here. We want to make sure prospects know when we ask a question. It's
    hard to sell stuff when you don't ask prospects to buy. Or if you did, and they didn't take
    it as a question. Rough.

I      And we don't just ask for the sale. We ask all sorts, for all sorts of stuff. And of the
    most important stuff we ask for, information ranks pretty high. The more information

     When You Don't Talk (Pauses) - Where and how long you don't talk. I think
pauses are the most powerful tone skill of all. Let's do a simple and effective exercise to
d e monstrate:

        1)    Read each sentence out loud.

        2)    Pause for a moment after saying each dashed word.

        3)   Soak in wha t h appened.

    I didn't say he-hit his wife. --+ I said someone else hit his wife

    I didn't say he hit his-wife. --+ I said he hit somebody else's wife

    I didn't say he hit his wife- --+ I said he hit somebody else



     I wrote the exact same sentence seven times ... or did I? The same words, yes. But
because we made a tiny change to how we say them-each sentence means something
different. Now, they all have totally different jobs. And all we did was change where we ...
didn't talk. That's scary power.
    Think of pauses like this:

    1)   Pauses focus attention on what you just said.

    2)   Longer pauses focus more attention than shorter pauses.

    3)   The more attention you focus on the word you just said, the more important
         you make it.

    We use three types of pauses. Short, medium, and long:

    1)   (...         Pauses that draw words out just enough to put more attention on
         or around that word.

    2)   (.)    Medium. Your normal pause. Like you'd use at the end of a sentence.
         A period in the middle of a sentence would mean you'd pause there as if you
         finished the sentence.

    3)   (-)     Lmig. Much longer than you'd normally use. These focus the most

   saying the wrong stuffwith ugly pauses at high speed. And all these tone shifts do the same thing.
   They tell the prospect that the closer has no idea what he is saying ... because he doesn't.
         So not only does the closer give the right words the worst possible job. He then goes on
   to give the wrong words the worst possible job. This isn't awkward at all. It's catastrophic.
         Thankfully, this is extremely easy to avoid. just breathe the script.




     Be grateful you don't have to spend thousands of hours to figure all this stuff out.
Believe me, I wish I could have just spent all that time selling. But now you can. And all
you have to do is just not talk where the script tells you to not talk ... and prospects often
close themselves. When mastered, pauses are extremely powerful.



    Advanced Tone Tactics - "Natural" is probably the most persuasive tone overall.
And I think most closers kinda know this already. But this means they often try to
"train" to speak "naturally". Training to speak naturally is another way of saying you try
to get good at pretending to speak naturally. This is one of the dumbest things you can
do. Instead of pretending to speak naturally, know the script so well it becomes natural.
In other words, if you don't want to sound like you're reading a script then don't read a
script. Breathe the script. Don't get cute. Problem solved.


     Bottom Line: You need to talk louder, clearer, and slower at all times. And you only
need to raise your pitch to ask a question, or insert a pause to focus attention-when the
script tells you to. But, you always put the longest pause after the buying question. This

(script) and making sure you give them the right job (tone). For the next part of Kill
Mode, I show what happens when the right words have the right job at each stage of the
close. Spoiler Alert: you'll probably close the deal.

                                         Introduction


       The introduction is the first 30- 60 seconds of every call. And it serves one purpo~e;
  ro frame the rest of the call. And you can blow a 30 minute call in 30 seconds. Yes, tts
  the shortest part ofthe script. But, you cannot close what you do not open.
         The start of every sale must have these four things:

         1) Your name.

      2)     That you call from ACQ.

      3)    That the call is recorded.

      4)    The reason you're calling.


    Some salesmen advise against this because they think it sounds "like a sales call"·
Here's why that's small time advice ...

     You start every call with those four things because, if you don't-you break the la.w.
So if you want to work at ACQ, you will follow the law. And following the law shouldn't
dampen your spirits. Let me explain why:

     First, I think it's a very effective opening for a call. It certainly hasn't stopped us from
closing sales.
    Second, consider that every large publicly traded company in the US does it, and
they still manage to make billions of dollars per year. So I'm pretty sure it works just
fine. Because, do you know what else it sounds like? A legitimate business.

    But to fully prove my point, let me show a simple example. Imagine a single guy
picked up the phone and heard ...


    1) This is the girl that got away

    2)     Calling from my bed

    3)     Because I know we had something special

                                      INTRO IN ACTION

   [PROSPECT's NAME]? · ·. Hey it's [REP] from Acquisition.com calling about [PRODUCT]
   on a recorded line-how's it going?
                                                ***
   Great. Excited for our call. We only have 20 minutes though. Cool if we jump in?
                                                  ***
   Let's do it. We'll just spend a couple minutes diving through your metrics to make sure you're
   a fit ... And-if so-happ y to walk you through [PRODUCT] ... and if things make sense we
   can get you all set up. Sound good?

    Long, clunky, forced intros do kill calls. And if you don't lose the prospec t, the
minutes you waste at the beginning are minutes you'll wish for at the end. Taking too long
could not only cost you the sale, but also cost you the referral you'd get from it too. Now
your undisciplined intro didn't just cost you one sale, it cost you two. For that reason, we
need to get through it as fast as possible. But this is where salespeople shoot themselves
in the foot:

    •    The intro is not small talk: ''How's the weather?" OR ''Did you see the fight?"

    •    The intro is not a pitch: 'Tm Tom. Want a vacuum cleaner? Ours really suck!"

    •    The intro is not a place to lie, skip parts, or talk fast. No place is.

    The intro is a place to ask the minimum required questions, with the minimu m
required words, delivered in the proper tone. And that's how you get through the intro
fast. End ofstory.

        The Discovery phase of a close call happens after the introductio n and before
    making the offer. And like the name suggests, we use it to discover things about the
    prospect. And in doing so, for a short period of time, heighten their awareness to all the
    bad things that are happening and all the good things that are not happening that not
    buying has caused.

        We discover two things: 1) The prospect's problems in their own words and 2) map
    them in our own words to things we solve with our offer (later). The prospect provides
    number one. You provide number two. So be ready to take notes.

         Now, it would be great if business owners came out and said, "here are my clearly
    labeled problems, they are incredibly important, and I must solve them immediatel y
    with all this excess cash and time I have lying around ... oh yea, and no one else makes
    decisions but me ... and I'm in a spendy mood."

         But ... that never happens. So, we have to pull it out of them. And the way we do
    that is by using the 9 Steps Of Discovery.



    The 9 Steps of Discovery



,       Discovery follows a nine-step process that cycles through identifying problems until
    you have enough to make your offer:

Step-by-Step Breakdown


Steps 1-2: Current and Desired (Establishing the Gap)
     Before we enter the Pain Cycle, we have to establish a gap between desired and
actual. This typically only takes a minute but you cannot skip it. If you don't know
where someone wants to go, how can you expect to give them directions?

     Up front we establish:

     I)    Current result - Why did you reach out? Where are you now?

     2)    Current goal - Outside of money, what are you trying co accomplish? What do
           you want to have happen?


Step 3: Obstacle (Current Obstacle)
                                                                                                                   l
     We di scover the prospect's problems by getting them to answer one question: "Why                            f
don't you have the results you want?" And the more reasons they give us, che better. This
is because every reason they can't get results is another reason for rhem ro buy.

Current obstacle - What's your biggest roadblock right now? What's holding you back?
    Important: We only care about problems we can solve. This means one simple
thing: we only ask the prospect about results in areas we can get good results. That's it.
Every good result we offer becomes a result of theirs we can ask about. And if it's not a
big enough problem, then we ask for somethin g else that is a big enough problem to put
chem through another Pain Cycle.



Step 4: Reason (Why It Failed)
Why it failed - Why? Example?
    This step digs deeper into understan ding the root cause of their obstacle. We want
specific examples and detailed explanations ofwhat went wrong and why ie's not working.



Step 5: Pull Teeth
    More often than you'd like, prospects will give vague, confusing, or incomple te
answers. And when this happens, it feels like prospects put you through a Pain Cycle.
No sweat, it just means it's time to start pulling teeth. See the method for each type of
bad answer below:



Vague: I see. Can you tell me more about that?

    Ok, cool. Can you give me an example?

Confusing: I see. Can you tell me more about that?
    Ok, cool. Can you give me an example?

Incomplete: I see. Can you cell me more about that?
    Ok, cool. Can you give me an example?

     This is straightfor ward but extremely important. And it may seem like a lot, but it's
not. You are just sharing what you learned and then making sure they agree.



Conclusio n

     The Discovery phase is complete when you've successfully identified and labeled
the prospect's key problems using their own words, then mapped those problems to the
solution categories your offer addresses. You now have a clear understand ing of their
current situation, desired outcomes, and the specific obstacles preventing them from
achieving their goals.

      And when they agree with your final recap, it's time to make an offer so good they'd
feel stupid saying no. In the next chapter, we'll explore how to map each labeled problem
to the specific solutions your offer provides, creating an irresistible connection between
their pain points and your product.

      You just went through Pain Cycles, pulled some teeth, and stacked the pain. Now,
it's time to offer our solution. Kind of. I say "kind of" because typical salespeople go
right to "pitching". Don't do that.

     Why trouble yourself with getting these pain points and then ... abandon them?
This sucks. Don't suck. Making offers at ACQ is more than just listing benefits and
asking for money. First, we map all the problems in the discovery phase to solutions
we provide-then we ask for money. In other words, we craft a personalized offer on the
spot. This crushes. And by the way. You have two minutes.

     Now if that doesn't sound like enough time, then one, you are wasting time. More
specifically-wasting words. Remember, talking between 150-170 words per minute
gives you about 320 words to make your offer. That is plenty of words if you know what
you're doing. It just means ... you must make every word count. So what words should you
say? Your solution stack.



How to Make The Offer

    To make the offer, we have to transition from discovery smoothly. We do this after
we recapped all the problems. It makes sense to then tell them you think we can help
them, then ask permission to share. As soon as they give you permission to share, you
present your notes from discovery right next to our solutions. So choose three of our
solutions and map their problems to those.

    Buying Objections:

         When you a~k a prosp ect to buy and they do anything
                                                                  other than buy, it lands us
    here. Now you migh t be think ing, "people don't buy stuff
                                                               for a million reasons, how can
    I remember how to deal with each one?" And honestly, I can
                                                                    see why you'd think that
    way. But here's the good news ...

        People may say a milli on different things to avoid buyin
                                                                    g. But when you chun k it
    up there are only five we care about. And last I checked, five is a lot
                                                                            less than a million,
    so we're in good shape.



    The 5 Objections to Buying:

    #1 Time - The prosp ect says they will not buy because they do
                                                                       not have the time to get
    the value. This is solved by finding lower value things they
                                                                   spend time on ... and getting
    them to agree they're not as valuable as taking the time to do what
                                                                          we're offering. In other
    words, not enou gh time is never an objection, only not a
                                                              high-     enough priority.
        Timing objec tions soun d like:

        •    I don't have time right now.

        •    I'm too busy.
        •    Maybe when things slow down.
I       • This isn't a good time for me.

      •   I have too much on my plate already.



#2 Moncy - The prospect says they are not abl e or no t willing to .pay the. price · lh·Is is
solved by showing how much the problem costs compared to the solution. This accounts for
roughly 50% of objections.

      Money objections sound like:

      •    1his isn't worth it.
      •   I can't afford it.
      •    1hat's too expensive.
      •   I don't have that kind of money.
      •   My budget won't allow it.
      •    I need to see if I can find the funds .
      •    1hat's more than I was expecting to spend.



#3 Decision-Maker - The prospect says they must get permission from somebody
else before they can buy. We solve this in three steps. First, we figure out if they need
permission ahead of time. If so, we get the decision-maker on the call. Second, we ask
if they think the decision-maker would feel ok with this based on past approvals. And if
they'd get approval anyway, we encourage them to decide now. Third, we book a follow
up call with the decision-maker.

      Decision-Maker obiections
                       ,        sound like:

      •    I can't make the decision without permission.

      •    I have to talk to my [spouse-partner-boss].

      •    We make decisions together.

           •
           •     My business partner handles these decisions.

           •     f can't move forward without approval.




 #4 Preference - The prospect says they expected something different or that they'd
  rather do something else. To solve this, first we remind them of the problem they want
 solved. Second) we pull out the short-, medium-, and long-term consequences of their
 current ways. Third, we explain why the way we do it is ultimately to their benefit. In
 short, we get them to realize that if we change the variables that create the outcome, we
 change the outcome.

       Preference obiections sound like:
                          '

       •        I don't like /specific thing} about the product.

    •           This isn't really what I had in mind.

    •          I was looking for something different.

    •          I don't think this is a good fit for me.

    •          I prefer a different approach.

    •          This doesn't match what I need.

    •          It's not for me.

    •          I don't think I'll be successful.



#5 Stall - The prospect says they must wait before they will buy. To solve this, we walk
them through a decision-making framework and then explain the cost of waiting: the
good stuff they miss out on and the bad stuff they'll keep suffering from .

   Stall objections sound like:

   •           I need time to think about it.
   • Let me sleep on it.

    So now we know pretty much that any reason                                            ne of
those buckets. This is good. It means we can prepare.



Preparing for Objections:
                                                  c l ' go over how.
     So now that we know what to prepare ror, et s

nice and simple. But handling objections is different. Theres a tradeoff. The tradeoff is
that nobody can really know which objections you'll have to handle, how many you'll
have to handle, or the order you'll have to handle them. We can guess of course. But
that's all it is. A guess. And a single slip will cost you the close. This means you have only
one way to prepare if you want to win:


                      You must be prepared for all objections all the time.


    Like we learned earlier, the Closing Script on its own doesn't matter much. It's skills
we apply to the script that matter. Objections are no different. Breathing the scripts is
mandated, but it is only the base of the preparation. Knowing how to respond to an
objection only matters if the prospect buys. So to truly handle an objection, you must
loop it back to the offer.

the "Gotcha" Moment

                 ,,                    ear tt     elOre. When the homeowner sa1 e

                                          ,     a esman pounce .
    "Actually, sir, I noticed your BMW in the driveway and the new deck you just built.
You're clearly not shore on money-you just don't see the value yet."
    The homeowner's jaw tightened. "Excuse me?"

     "Look, I get it. Everyone says they can't afford it. But you spent more on that car
payment than this system costs per year. It's not about money-it's about priorities,
right?"

    The man stepped back, his hand moving toward the door. "I chink we're done here."

     "Wait, I'm just being honest with you. Mose people who say they can't afford
something really mean they don't wane to spend money on it. I'm trying to help you see
that your family's safety is worth more than your luxury car."

    The door slammed shut.

     "You called him a liar co his face," his sales manager said later. "Even if people use
'can't afford it' as an excuse, you don't challenge chem on it directly."

    "But he obviously had money. The BMW, the deck, the nice house ... "

    "Doesn't matter. You made him feel foolish and attacked. You could have said,
'That's a fair point. What would need to happen for this to make sense financially?'
Same goal, no confrontation."

The Wrong Way to Handle Objections

                                           This is very wrong




     Here's what bad closers think will happen.

     •    Prospect says dumb thing.

     •    Closer says smart thing .

     •     Prospect thanks Closer for dealing with their dumbness .

     •     Prospect buys .

     •     Everyone lives happily ever after.

     And this makes perfect sense. . . in fantasy land.

     In the real world, this is what tends to happen . ..


     •    Prospect says dumb thing.

     •    Closer says smart thing.

     •    Prospect gets embarrassed -+ They feel stupid .

     •    Prospect gets pissed off-+ Closer made them feel stupid .

          Prospect now h as a good objection -+ Closer is an asshole .

    And if you're wondering. I don't train the "your closer is an asshole" objection. And
chat's because I don't keep assholes on the team.

     In any case, knowing how to handle objections will make or break you at any level.
frust 111 e. It isn't as simple as winning an argument. You're not on the debate team.
You're on the ACQ sales team. If you try to win arguments with prospects, everyone loses.


                         You are not here to argue with prospects.
                                You are here to close them.


    Bottom Line: Catching a prospect in a silly excuse is good. Expecting them to
magically buy because you caught them in a silly excuse is worse than letting them walk.
Jc makes ACQ look like a bunch of assholes. And that is why it is the wrong way to
handle objections.

    So now you know the wrong way to handle objections. This sets us up nicely to go
over the right way.



The Right ~y to Handle Objections
     Looping is a technique to overcome objections by acknowledging their objection,
presenting your additions, and then looping the prospect back to the offer. It is the best
"universal" method I know of, and it's super simple to do. After you calmly and concisely
add to their reasoning, you save them embarrassment by then immediately giving them
the opportunity to buy again.

     But it doesn't end there. Most prospects who object once often have their pockets
full of objections. But, no matter how silly the objection, you must never ever insult
the objection itself. You will only address its content. This is where your tone skills are
incredibly important.

    You must have perfect talking speed, volume, and enunciation. And your pitch and
pauses must be on voint. With those variables controlled, the prospect will never feel
insulted or embarr;ssed and call off the deal.

Handling the First Objection

      So you get your first objection. Now what?


                                                Ignore it


    Hear me out. Before getting into objection whack-a-mole, we need to know
something very important: Do they think our product is valuable? To get that information
we must confirm the value.


                                           Confirming Value

     I completely hear you... do you mind if I ask you a question ... Do you think doing [Product} is
     something that can help get you closer to [Goal}?




    And no matter what they say you follow up with _. a triage question. The main
objective is to get them to abandon their "reflex" objection. This way, you isolate the
objection worth handling.                                                                               (

                                           Triage Question

    Super helpful. What's the biggest thing holding you back ... Tell me your main concern?



     Now that we,ve confirmed the value we can get to the first loop.



The Second Objection and Beyond

-                                  Objection Looping Framework

    Verify: Objection -+ (Acknowledge -+ Confirm Value)
                                                   ***
    Loop 1: Objection -+ (Acknowledge -+ Address -+ Ask)
    Loop 2: Objection -+ (Acknowledge -+ Address -+ Ask)
    Loop 3: Objection -+ (Acknowledge -+ Address -+ Ask)
    Loop 4: ... Until you close




     Once you: Confirm Product Value, the Looping officially begins. Woo!

     The Objection Loop has three steps:

     When the prospect objects, you ...

     1) Acknowledge/Agree with the objection.

     2) Address the objection.

     3) Ask for the sale again. lmmediate~y.

     If the prospect objects again. You ... go through the loop again. Also, remember
that the loop includes asking for the sale. This means you keep looping until one of two
things happen. They buy or you run out of time.

     Loop3
        •     Objection: I have to ask my wife. She's the boss around here.
        •     Acknowledge/Agree: Makes sense about your wi.fo.
        •     Address: What if we included her in the onboarding call so she's folly informed? Would
              that address her concerns? [They agree]
        •     Ask: Excellent, let's get you all set up.



     Learning to agree and add rather than contradict a prospect is why top closers can
handle 5, 10, even 15 objections in a single call-they're comfortable staying in the loop
until they reach agreement. We will teach you how to do this.

     What comes after the "AGREE ... AND ... " will be the line of reasoning we add to
their own, depending on their reason. These are covered in the script bank in the back
of the handbook.
     On a personal note: The more I've studied sales and persuasion, the less I think
the response you give matters. The part that I think matters is being able to ask again.
Which is why agreement is so important-to buy you more opportunities to ask again.
If they feel good, they'll buy. So make them feel good. Here's the perfect example to
reinforce my point. These are some of the top closes I've used in my life . .. and you can
say them to any prospect after any reason they give. To me this further reinforces that
logic matters almost not at all. (This is controversial - but - I don't want you to be right.
I want you to be rich.)

     . . . I think that's the exact reason you should come. What do you think?

                BAMFAM stands for ll.ook A Meeting Erom A Meeting.


     Salespeople learn lots of stuff. One that's rarely taught is how to properly end a call
that doesn't close. And the way you do that is ... by booking another call.

   And chat's totally okay. Sometimes closing takes more than one call. When it does,
.secure a time for the next call while on the current call. Closes cake more than one call
 for three major reasons:

    1) Time Constraint

   2)    Prospect depends on Decision-Maker

    3)   Banking Delay (For very high ticket)



Time Constraint BAMFAM

      When you start running out of time ... You must secure the next call on the current
call. Do not say "we'll follow up offline". You're both there now. So give yourself the
three minutes. If you won't book a call while on a call, what chance do you have when
you're texting them like some scorned lover?

    Referrals are when our cu st0 mers send us more customers. We want lots of referrals.
cusromers do se nd referrals on their own, but it works even better if we just ask for
(hel11•··

     When to ask custo mers to introduce you to their friends:

    •       Right after you close them and collect payment information. If you run out of time
            on the call, adapt this to text.

    •       After they start a text thread with you and share anything positive. This is
            a very good time. Closers get positive texts from customers most often after
            they: 1) Come to HQ or 2) Get good results from something we helped them
            implement. They text you because they want you to sell them.

    Asking for referrals gets you the simplest, cheapest, fastest, easiest, highest-converting
opportunities. This is the single most lucrative use of your outbound time. You should
be able to net one extra deal per day. This is the least work per sale out of anything in this
handbook. Yet, few salespeople do it because they are afraid of sounding like a douche.
But when you do it our way, you won't sound like a douche. And that's why you'll win.



Referral Process

    I) Compliment them - Tell them they're amazing to work with. This makes them
            like you more and happier they bought.

    2) Get introduction - Then ask who they know as successful as them (a second
            compliment) that they'd want to come with them, which also improves their
            experience. Win-win.

    3) Give them words to use: If they say yes, ask them to start a group chat.

          What Being The Top .01 % Looks Like


         "People want what you have, not what you did to get it. " - Jimmy Carr


   February 2010.

   In the fall every year, we would "rush" freshmen to join our fraternity. And every
year, they'd begi~ pledging. They'd go from being courted, entertained, everyone le~rning
their names-bein g made to feel special. To-overnig ht (literally), being told to pick up
the trash from their own parties, being treated "poorly," and generally suffering.

     And every year, like clockwork, within two weeks of pledging starting, the entire
class would attempt to quit. As chance would have it, the year I was president of the
fraternity the same thing happened. The pledge class tried to quit on us because pledging
'wasn't what they thought it would be'.

    So, they asked me to talk to them as a group across campus at the freshmen dorms.
Their home turf haha. I knocked on the door with my VP and entered a hot four-person
dorm room with twenty-four guys crammed into it. Four guys on the edge of every bed.
Every wall space taken and every college futon covered in 19-year old frustrated guy.

   I sat'd, "So, w h ats
                       ' up.~,,

   All at once they began shouting out their grievances:

    "This isn't what we were promised!" "Yea! This isn't right!" "We shouldn't have to
he doing this!" "I have to focus on school!"

    After a minute, it died down. I asked them, "Forget the pledging process for a
second. Who wanted to be a part of this fraternity?"

    They all reluctantly raised their hands.
    "Okay good. Now, something like that is pretty cool, right?" Silent nods of
agreement. "Now when you heard about our reputation, you thought it was cool that
We Were so tightly knit. And you wanted to be a part of something like that right?" Nods
of agreement.

   To be top .Olo/o, you need to enter a room of 10,000 and leave #1.


    That's a stadium. In a battle to the death in a stadium, you have to come out on top.
You beat everyone. Not almost everyone. Everyone.

   If you have the goal to be in the top .01 %:

   Do you think you can live a normal life?

   Do you think you can keep the same friends?

   Do you think you can keep the same hobbies?

   Do you think you can stay up late and sleep in on weekends?

   Do you think you don't have to sacrifice what average people care about?

   Do you think they will support you when you start to pass them?

   Do you think anyone will think this is healthy? balanced? ... logical?

   No. And they are right.
    But it doesn't matter. When you want to be .01 %, there's no greater waste of time
than explaining yourself to people who actively don't support you. It's normal for people
to not understand why you do what you do.


     I say this because you cannot make yourself exceptional and live a normal life. To
make yourself exceptional, you must live an exceptional life. And an exceptional life does
not always mean better. It means it is so different that most people will reject it-and
you. And when that happens, you must reject them as well. Oil and water do not mix.
That is what it really means to be exceptional. You must become the exception.

                          Appendix: Script Bank


     fhe first part of th e _book tells you my philosophy in general. The scripts for ACQ
      ·tored from th at plulosophy for ACQ use cases. The appendix contains the scripts
 re ra1                    ...
a 'll start with at acquismon.com. Some of them appear to bend or break the rules we
        ver. I'll explain why:
you t
,-,en 0
    1) These scripts operate together as part of a larger sales process. So variables that
          aren't covered in one are likely covered in another part of the process. Ex: our
          inbound closing script is "light" on pain cycle. Main reason: they have to watch
          one to two videos prior to the call. So_in the spirit of maximizing closes per rep,
          we trimmed that section because it wasn't necessary to maximize close rates.

    2) Our brand is different from many companies. We have many prospects who
          already know who we are. This means that some selling has already occurred.
          Similar to point one-other variables exist that already "made the horse more
          likely to drink". So, we accommodate for that in the scripting.

    3) Just as different prospects may require different scripting, so too do different
       products. So even if not every script has all of the elements, it's good to
       understand all of the elements for future products and services you may sell
       during your tenure at ACQ.

     Beyond that, this handbook focuses primarily on giving you an understanding of
your schedule, training, and expectations. The kill mode section gives an understanding
of how to perform the script. The scripts give you the words to perform. You don't need
to edit or change anything-j ust say the right words at the right time in the right way and

you'll succeed.

     Learn them. Breathe them. And you'll do great. The appendix includes the following
scripts.

     "I don't think I can learn in that big of a group"
     Do you mind if I share how we structure the [PRODUCT]?



     *Wait for response*


     It actually starts before you even arrive-we send you pre-work to understand your
r    business- and make sure you're prepped to get the most out of it-Then, at the
     [PRODUCT], we don't waste time with broad theories. Instead... we dive dircaly
    into your biggest bottlenecks. You'll work in small groups with our top directors-co
    solve specific challenges in your business. And again, the goal is you walk away with
    3-5 clear- tactical-steps you can implement. Does that give you more conrat and
    confidence we could help?



    *Wait for response*



    "How is this different than the free content?"

    Great question ... because everything you need to scale is already online ....The difference
    is that free content tells you what to do; the [PRODUCT] shows you how co do it-
    specifically for your business. Instead of generic advice, we tailor the strategies co solve
    your unique challenges. For example, you can't ask a question about your business co
    Alex's book.

.And the rca._~n most entrepreneurs lean towards the [PRODUCT] is speed. You could
 spend a lot of time testing and trying different routes to scale or we could tell you what
                                                                                              Q
 we know works because we've done it before.Does that clear that up for ya? ASK FOR
ORDER


IF STILL A NO:
Hcrc•s the biggest thing,,, all the information is out there...


The question is how long will it take you to find it ... ? long time right?

So with the [PRODUCT] you're paying for time .. .instead of searching or testing what
to do ... you're going to be guided on exactly what to do from a team that does this
everyday. ASK FOR ORDER
"I went to II simi/4r [PRODUCT} and I didn,t like it"
Completely hear you ... and how many people were at those events?
And did you get to work with and get personalized help from the speakers?

So do you feel maybe they just weren't tactical enough?
Got it-that makes complete sense. Mind ifl share how our [PRODUCT] is structured?

First off, if you're looking for a RA.RA event, chis isn't chat.
Bue...What it is-is a hands-on workshop designed to create a customized roadmap to
scale your business.
Before you even arrive, we send pre-work so we understand your business and you're
fully prepped.
During the [PRODUCT], there's no fluff-just deep dives into your biggest constraints.

You'll work in small groups direccly with our top directors-advisors in [PRO BLEM]-
to solve real challenges in your business.

By the end, you'll leave with 3-5 clear, tactical steps to implement.

Does chat give you more confidence char chis would actually be valuable?                      0

    /    "I'm too smallfor this''
         Totally hear you. Mind if I share how we structure the [PRODUC17?


         And yes there will be larger businesses here, BUT we group you with businesses of
        similar size, so everything is directly relevant. Some will be a step or two ahead, ochers
        a step behind-giv ing you both clear next steps and allowing you to see around the
        corner.


        And honestly, businesses of your size tend to get the most out of this. Because being
        around larger businesses for two days isn't going to hurt the business ... it usually gives
        new perspective

        Yes there will be smaller businesses here but we group you with businesses at a similar
        scale, so everything is directly relevant.



        You won't be sitting next to someone doing $1M when you're at [REVENUE MARK],
        but you will be in a room with entrepreneu rs solving the same high-level problems-and
        even some larger companies that can show you what's around the corner.



        Long story shore. We group you by revenue.



        Does that give you more context we can help?

Do you mind if rm upfront with you?



yeah so typically almost everyone is ready to lock in their spot ... and if not it's really
because of 1 or 2 reasons.




    1) They don't see the value .. .I mean do you see it? Cool I'm confident this will
       help.

    2) Logistically they need to make sure it will work...



So is it number 2 or something crazy? Haha



"I always take 24 hours to make a decision"
100% respect that, just out of curiosity is there any new information that's making you
reconsider?



Do you mind if I share some perspective on that.
