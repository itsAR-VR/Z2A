Why People Struggle To Advertise And How To Fix It

The reason most people struggle to advertise is... they spend too much time making new
ads and not nearly enough time doubling down on the ads that work.

This handbook is separated into three parts. Part I will help you double down on the ads
that work using my Ad Kaleidoscope. Part II will help you find the ads to double down on
with My Best 20 Ad Frameworks Of All Time. Part III will give you checklists to follow for the
next time you make ads.

I start the handbook with Ad Kaleidoscope because if you already have ads, you should
use this immediately to make more money And for those of you who don’t have ads, I’ll give
you my 20 best ad frameworks of all time to make them. In short, if you have winning ads,
use the Ad Kaleidoscope. If you don’t have winning ads, I’ll let you use mine.

And before we dive in, I want to be clear, any business (no matter what industry) can
model the examples in both Ad Kaleidoscope and My Ads Blackbook to advertise better.
Especially yours. So, use them.

Happy hunting,
Alex

PART I: AD KALEIDOSCOPE

When some is good, more is better.

Henry Ford walked the same hallway to his factory floor every morning. For three
straight months he passed the glass door of his chief marketing officer and saw the exact
same print layout pinned on the wall: a black-and-white ad for the Model T. Days later,
Ford stopped, pushed the door open, and asked, “When are we going to stop running that
ad? I’m tired of looking at it."

The chief marketing officer smiled. “Mr. Ford, we haven’t run it once. You’ve seen it a
hundred times because you work here. The public hasn’t even seen it yet.”

Moral: You will tire of your advertising before your prospects even know your name.
You make campaigns for them, not for you. And when an ad finally works, keep running it,
until it stops working—never until you get bored.

PART I: AD KALEIDOSCOPE
Kaleidoscope Ads

The Ad Kaleidoscope so valuable I wanted to make it a standalone item to draw
attention to its importance. But, it’s too deep to be in a wider book. So I’ve been holding
onto it for a while trying to find the right moment. And the right moment is now.

The Ad Kaleidoscope is my tool for taking winning ads and multiplying them. I think
it’s the most important tool I use to run paid ads.

If you’ve consumed my stuff before then you know I rely on “more, better, new” as my
growth strategy for... pretty much everything. And that’s because it works.

The Ad Kaleidoscope is “more, better, new” applied to advertising. It works so well because
it puts advertising-specific action items on all three growth elements. The Ad Kaleidoscope
puts out more volume. And makes that volume better. And generates new winners.

It all happens because the Ad Kaleidoscope harnesses power law. Aka - the Pareto
Principle. In other words, using the fact that 80% of advertising results come from 20% of
winners. And only 20% of the results come from 80% of your effort.

Inputs Outputs

In an ideal world, you would make the 100% of your ads like the 20% that get 80% of
the results. And if you do that, you get 5x the output. And that’s what the Ad Kaleidoscope
does. It would look something like this...

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION				4

=== Page 9 ===
PART I: AD KALEIDOSCOPE

The image wouldn’t fit if I made the new output proportional. But you get the point. If
you spend 80% of your effort making permutations of ads that are already proven—you’ll
make more winning ads than if you start from scratch every time.

Think of it like this... imagine you had two advertisers, both of whom made 100 ads.
One made 100 brand new ads, while the other took his top five ads from the month before
and made 100 versions of those five winners. Who do you think would wind up next month? No
question: the guy who put his effort into replicating winners.

If you agree with that premise, then you will love this. It will also likely make you a lot
of money. At least, it has for me.

So, this section will show you how to use the Ad Kaleidoscope like a pro. And the good
news is you only need to know two things:

1) What The Ad Kaleidoscope Is
2) How To Use It
Keep using it until you’ve made more money than you need, or die. Whichever comes
first. That’s my plan anyways.

PART I: AD KALEIDOSCOPE

What The Ad Kaleidoscope Is

The Ad Kaleidoscope permutates winning ads. In other words, it tweaks stuff that already
worked. It takes old winners and makes new ones.

I call it the Ad Kaleidoscope because it works like a kaleidoscope. As you turn the dial of
the kaleidoscope, you see a hundred different versions of whatever you’re looking at. You’re
still looking at the same thing, but what you’re seeing is obviously different. That’s what the
Ad Kaleidoscope does.

For example, this ad was the highest converting Skool ad for a few months. We spent
over $100,000 on this single ad creative alone.

• Same Ad. New Background/Border: It can be as simple as changing the background
color in the ad. You can also put a thin trim around the border of the ad (especially true
with images). You can vary the colors of the trim as well.

• Same Ad. New Fonts/Captions: You can change the fonts you use in the text for the ad
or headline.

• Same Ad. New Headline: On some platforms, you can put different headlines on top of
an ad, or you can put a headline on the top third of the ad itself.

• Same Ad. New Medium: Take a winning hook or headline from a video. Make it into
a standalone static image.

• Same Ad. New Format: Make different versions native to each ad placement on each
platform.

=== Page 13 ===
• Same Hook. New Meat: When you find your best performer, pair the winning hook
with a different "ad meat" you've already recorded. (Note: I don't have a screenshot because
it would be identical, but this is the structure)

Hook 1 Meat 1 Hook 1 Hook 1 Meat 2 CTA 1

• Same Ad. New Visual Effects: You can add or change the visual effects in the original
ad. You can add doodads and wizbangs to your heart's desire. The ones that will matter
most are the ones you do earlier (the hook), since this is what most people will see first.

When remixing, you vary all the aforementioned. That means once you find your
winner, you can immediately make a kajillion variations by changing combinations of the
variables. And since these can all be done on a computer, that means lots more ads without
extra recording time.

Beyond that though, remixes tend to fatigue faster than remakes. Main reason—they
tend to look more similar, which is both good and bad. Good because the original worked.
Bad because they won't have the same "shef life" as more differentiated ads.

So to create remakes, you need to record again (or using AI, generate new subject matter).
And that leads us to the other way of making permutations...:

=== Page 14 ===
Remaking Winners
Remakes happen during recording. This means we're actually changing the real world
components of the ad. That's what differentiates this list from the list above— you actually
need to record again. As such they take more efforts, which is why I put them second. But,
this is where you can keep a winner performing for years. To be clear though, you should be
doing both simultaneously if you really want to advertise like a pro.

These are all the different ways to take an existing ad and remake it without losing what
made it a winner to begin with. Like before, these are my favorite ways to remake my highest
performing ads into hundreds of variations:

Same Ad ... (again from easiest to hardest)
• New Clone- Same everything, just hit record again
• New Props - Swap one object for another
• New Examples - Change names/numbers in same script
• New Setting - Move to different location
• New Talent - Find, coordinate, and direct different person
• New Combination - Multiple changes at once

Like before, I put example images below the text that describes them. Let's dive in.

• New Clone: You literally record the same ad again in a new session. Like fingerprints, no
two recording sessions will be exactly the same. Time of day, weather, lighting, sound,
will all create tiny variations that make it different enough to convert like new.

=== Page 15 ===
• New Props: If you didn't use props before, add them now. If you did use props before, use
new ones (or remove them!). This also includes costumes, hair styles, jewelry/accessories,
and so on. This creates significant variation while allowing for the same winning script...
so it stays likely to convert. In the example, I removed the banana prop.

• New Examples: Record the same ad, but use a different example as either the hook or
the meat. In this ad, I start with the last month's lowest performer on the leaderboard.
The next month, I swapped the number and the name of the person. The rest of the ad
remained the same. And... it worked again.

• New Setting: The same script of your winning ad in a different setting. You can do the
same ad at the beach, in your car, or in your office. A different place makes the same ad
new again. On the left, I record in my studio. On the right, I record the same script in
my office.

• New Talent: Record the same ad with different people. Ideally, you should find talent
that looks like the people that buy your stuff. For example, if you make stuff for
midwestern men ages 18–25 then... then make more versions with different 18–25 year
old midwestern men! If you want more women, then use more women. This is a wildly
underutilized variation style.

=== Page 16 ===
• New Combinations You can do a new prop coupled with a new post-production
effect. You can have new talent say the same script with a new filter or headline. The
combinations give you endless permutations. Once you find a winner, milk it for all
it's got.

Here's the beauty of this—you're putting the most effort into the thing that has the
highest likelihood of winning. This is leverage. You get a higher return on your time.

Next Steps
When starting, run as many ads as you can until you find a winner. As soon as you do,
run it through the Kaleidoscope—and make more winners. 80% of your energy goes into
making Kaleidoscope variations, and the other 20% goes into a totally new ad that beats
the original winners. The Kaleidoscope keeps you competitive now, the new ads keep you
competitive forever. And that's what this is all about.

It's so simple, the only thing simpler is not doing it—which is what most people do—and
get the results most people get: none.

With that being said, Kaleidoscope is about getting more from winners. But, if you
don't have any winners... I'll let you borrow mine.

PART II: MY ADS BLACKBOOK:
BEST 20 AD FRAMEWORKS
OF ALL TIME

These are the 20 best ad frameworks of all time. I demonstrate my five best frameworks
across four different businesses: Gym Launch, ALAN, Skool, and $100M Leads.

When I called this a Blackbook, I meant it. I refer to this list whenever I make ads today.
Period. In fact, if you're reading these words right now, it proves they work.

I use these ad frameworks across different industries and they still crush. So no matter
what business you're in, you can use these ad frameworks to achieve better results.

I'm going to say this again because someone is gonna say "This ad is for B2B, so it won't
work for me" or "This ad is about making money so it won't apply to my lawncare service".
You're wrong. It will. You just need to replace the blocks with words that describe your
service/product and benefits. Do not think "this won't work for me" think "how can I make
this work for me". Every great entrepreneur I know thinks this way. So you might as well
start now. If you want to test yourself, you should be able to turn every ad into a B2C, B2B,
service, SaaS, or product ad. That's how you'll really know you've "gotten it".

What You'll See for Every Winning Ad Framework
1) Ad Framework Type
2) Why This Ad Framework Rocks: how this ad came to be, why I like it, and other
useful tidbits
3) Thumbnail & Links So you can watch and see them in action.
4) Visual Hooks A description of the first three seconds of motion and design that
stopped the scroll.
5) Ad Copy: The exact words from the ad. I also include within the copy me breaking
down what's happening as it's happening (I DO THESE IN ALL CAPS). I find it
more useful than doing it separately.
6) How To Apply This Framework: Directions to follow to apply this style and
structure to advertise whatever you sell. This comes in two parts. The "what to say"
and the "how to show it". So, you'll also see more visual notes than you're probably
used to from me. I do this so you can actually make these winners for your business.

What To Do Next
For anyone who needs winners, these frameworks will give you a headstart. For anyone
who already has winners, these will just give you more.

These are the output of tens of millions of dollars and years of iterations. They are my
greatest hits. These ads funded payroll, paid mortgages, and scaled four companies. Now
they're yours. Use them responsibly—preferably to put a dent in your revenue ceiling.

With that said, let's start.

Section I: My Best Gym Launch Ad Frameworks
Inside this section I'll give you my five best Gym Launch ad frameworks. I break them
down in the following order:
1) Personal Testimonial Ad
2) Prop Comedy Ad
3) Emotional Avatar Testimonial Ad
4) Show Don't Tell Ad
5) Long Term Results Ad

Now that we got formalities out of the way, let's dive into the ad framework that started
it all...

Ad Framework #1: Personal Testimonial/Origin Story

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
Believe it or not, the first time this ad framework worked, it was with a video I didn't
even intend to be an ad. I made it for an online group I was a part of. I wanted to show how
crazy a particular launch location was. Tons of people in the group said it was cool. Then
one of them told me I should run it as a "meme style ad". I didn't know how to do that, so
she showed me how to put meme style captions on a video. Then, I launched it... and it
took off.

This ad framework functions like one gigantic open loop. The entire ad builds mystery.
But, through building mystery, it also eliminates many of the implied objections that people
have about why something won't work with their gym (location, bad neighborhood, gym size,
price point, age, etc).

It claims a ridiculous compute up front, then shows circumstances that are opposite to
what you'd expect to get that kind of outcome. Then, it keeps expanding on this open loop
by stacking "anti-proof" of the situation until it finally snaps the loop closed or "pays off"
the viewer at the very end with the stack of $500 bills (signed contracts).

Any business can easily think about a situation that would make it less than ideal for
a customer to get an outcome. Show all of those negatives in a row. Then show an insane
outcome to prove your thing works regardless of circumstance.

This works because there was a big promise, fast timeline, and the delivery/setting made
it believable. It eliminates all the reasons someone would say it didn't work for them in the
ad itself with a massive payoff of proof at the end.

This ad, and subsequent framework, took me from broke to not broke. It changed my
life. It also goes to show you that you don't need to be fancy to win. Just use what you've got.

Visual Hooks:
• Shaky selfie style ad creates extra movement and looks more social native.
• Pans to show the entire neighborhood.
• This is definitely curiosity-driven when paired with the verbal hook. The prospect
might wonder: What is he showing us? What's the humble brag?

Hey guys, I wanted to show you something kind of cool, a little bit of a humble brag, but,
um, yeah. (HOOK - not the best hook, but it seemed so authentic, it worked)

=== Page 25 ===
Meat/Offer
So I'm opening this gym in kind of the middle of nowhere. It doesn't really look like, it's
like a residential kind of neighborhood, kind of sketchy, (DAMAGING ADMISSION) but
I wanna show you something (CURIOSITY). So, even though, you know, don't let your
circumstances make you feel like your, uh, uh, like you can't sell, usually it's just your pitch.

Um, she's like, how sketchy does this look right? (CURIOSITY) I'd be sketched out. So people
are coming up these stairs, they're like, oh my God, I'm doing their (CURIOSITY).
Looks so sketchy. Look at these bars and the windows. Oh my God, what am I getting
into? (CURIOSITY) Like, what is this? (CURIOSITY) Like, ah, I'm saying, yeah, this
is gonna be a gym. (DAMAGING ADMISSION/RELATABILITY - the entire intro is a
combination of curiosity-driven and relatable)

It's gonna be amazing. Look, we got some stuff here. Here's a bathroom that I don't even
know. Here's some stuff. Here's some stuff. What's going on? (CURIOSITY) Hold on. So
the other side's like, wait, is it an apartment? (CURIOSITY) I don't even know. Is it sort of,
it's like in the middle of the living room, there's some paintings on the wall and this is it,
right? (CURIOSITY)

But somehow, here's the cool part.

These are all 500 bills, so (DREAM OUTCOME/PROOF)

you can sell wherever you want. So, uh, don't let that stop you.

How To Apply This Ad Framework:
Make a wild promise/claim in the first five seconds. Open with the end result your
prospects crave ("We added $42k in 19 days"). Keep it short—no details yet. (The ad does
this visually rather than in the copy).

Show yourself in an obviously "wrong" environment. Film in a setting that looks
incompatible with the promise (run-down storefront, tiny bedroom office, deserted parking
lot, etc). Mention the flaws aloud (bad neighborhood, zero foot traffic, ugly walls, ancient
equipment).

Walk the viewer through a rapid "problems tour". Move the camera and rattle off
every objection prospects normally raise: "Too hard to find." "No fancy decor." "Prices look
crazy high." "We're brand new / too old / too small." Each objection is "anti-proof" that
keeps curiosity piqued.

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION

=== Page 26 ===
Expand the open loop and stack more negatives. Keep revealing fresh reasons success
shouldn't happen here (broken sign, cramped space, outdated website). Let curiosity build.
Offer no resolution yet.

Snap the loop closed with overwhelming proof. End the tour by showing irrefutable,
evidence into the focus: A stack of cash, signed contracts, fully booked calendar. Shopify
dashboard—all tied to the original wild promise/claim. Say one plain sentence that connects
dots ("If we can sell here, you can sell anywhere.").

Deliver the takeaway and soft CTA. Tie the lesson to the prospect's own limiting
belief ("Your results aren't about location—just the pitch"). Invite them to the next step
(download, book a call, start a trial).

Ad Framework #2: Prop Comedy

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
I always wanted to make a “Dollar Shave Club” style ad but never had the resources (or
skill). Finally, I had a good enough videographer to do this with. So we scripted the whole
thing out. One phrase at a time. Then tried to pair each phrase with some prop/scene that
was funny and fast moving.

This was an entertaining ad. The music and visuals do a lot of work here. It's clear and to
the point. We taught gyms how to advertise, so our ads had to be good. Our ads were proof
that we knew what we were doing. These types of ads don't try to do too much. The point is
to get the right person to click with the right intent. This accomplishes that.

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION

=== Page 28 ===
Visual Hooks:
• First scene already in the gym, because I'm targeting gym owners. This seems obvious,
and yet so few people ever do it. Your avatar should immediately see the background,
clothing, and spokesperson as "like them" to increase the likelihood they respond.
• Motion on camera (approaching subject), motion on subject (lifting weights).
• Second scene changes within half a second.

Ad Copy:
Hook
Are you a gym owner? (CALL OUT)

Meat/Offer
Do you want high ticket online clients? (DREAM OUTCOME)
Do you want this in as little as 30 days? (SPEED)
It's possible. We're already doing it. (PERCEIVED LIKELIHOOD)

CTA
To find out how you can too, click the link, download the case studies, schedule a call time.
We'll see you on the other side. (CTA)

How Apply This Ad Framework:
Map the value-equation questions. Write three to four "Yes" prompts that hit dream
outcome, speed, ease, and proof. Ex: "Are you a gym owner?" → "Want high-ticket clients in
30 days?" Keep each line three to five seconds max. The last one should be a CTA.

Assign one prop + one mini-setting per line. Make sure the first setting is one your
avatar recognizes so they know it's for them. After that, try and match the prop to the line if
you can. If you can't, just try to make it fun and interesting.

Film each line separately. Shoot all lines in order but as individual clips. Keep talent
centered and moving (step forward, lift prop, spin around).

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION

=== Page 29 ===
Use whip-cuts or camera swings between clips. Finish each clip with a fast pan; start
the next clip continuing that motion. The momentum "drags" viewers forward without
missing a beat. "This is super important for the pace of the ad"

Layer upbeat music with captions. Choose a royalty-free track (found that out the
hard way). Make captions in huge, high-contrast font to match the spoken line.

Finish with a CTA card. Show the CTA with the spokesperson pointing to it. Freezeframe the last card for one full second so they have time to read it and take action. Bonus
points: I learned this later, actually screenshare the page they'll go to and demonstrate opting in
so they know what happens next.

Ad Framework #3: Emotional Avatar Testimonial

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
This ad framework absolutely CRUSHES. It birthed one of my best ads of all time
(broken down below). We easily ran 100+ variations of this one piece of creative alone. And
they all performed.

This ad features Cale and Maggie who were some of my first Gym Launch customers.
Their lives had obviously changed since using the systems at Gym Launch. They asked if
they could do anything for me in return. I asked them to film a testimonial and gave them
six points to hit: 1) what was life like before personally and 2) professionally, 3) What
skepticism did you have and 4) why did you choose to take action anyways. 5) What was life
after like personally and 6) professionally.

And they knocked it out of the park. I don't think we've had a testimonial outperform
this one in the company's history. Let's break it down so you can use it.

- We were two months
from shutting our doors.

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION

=== Page 32 ===
Visual Hooks
• Visual proof begins showing Cale and Maggie with their gym behind them. Again,
make sure the ideal avatar thinks “this is for me”. Cale and Maggie look and talk
like gym owners (because they are). This also—unsurprisingly—brought in more
married couple owners.
• The frame changes within half a second to an extremely empty looking gym and a
sad looking Cale.
• Emotional music is also playing (we remixed dozens of different music variations).

Ad Copy:
Hook
We were two months from shutting our doors. (HOOK)

Meat/Offer
When we started, we had about 31 members (PAIN). We were making about four grand a
month (PAIN). Maggie was pregnant with our second (STAKES). I had actually gone and
gotten another job in order just to literally put food on the table (PAIN). I was working
really long hours, coaching in the morning, going to work (PAIN).

Coaching in the evening wasn't sustainable (PAIN). There was no light at the end of the
tunnel (PAIN). We weren't happy with where we were at (PAIN), and we joined Gym Launch
(TURNING POINT). We buckled down and we followed the system and we followed it
to a T. 18 months later. Um, I haven't coached a class in a year (LESS BAD STUFF). Now
we've gone from 31 members to over 200 easily. (MORE GOOD STUFF)

They're also taught me to make ads that don't just attract your genre of customer (any
gym owner), but the exact customer you want (advanced gym owner). And the easiest way to
do that is talk about the things those customers care about. So be specific. Use language that
only the upper echelon of customers would understand.

For the most part, you'll get the upper market and the smaller market. But only talking
to a beginner never gets the advanced guy. And besides, no one else will talk to the advanced
customer because they're afraid to ostracize any customers. So it's ripe for the taking.

CTA
There's a better way to build a gym, download these 11 frameworks that we use to build
million dollar gyms (CTA).

How To Apply This Ad Framework:
Pick a client and record them in a setting that communicates that they're like your
avatar visually. This instantly signals "for gym owners" and, by showing both spouses fit
and present, pulls in married-owner prospects.

Show sad setting fast. Cut within half a second to an empty, gloomy shot of the same
setting and add a gentle, emotional soundtrack. The visual contrast plus music sets the
mood for hardship before words are spoken.

Open with a blunt pain statement. "We were two months from shutting our doors"
then stack five-to-six rapid-fire pains and stakes. Ex: low member count, tiny revenue,
pregnancy, second job, and crushing work hours—each line a quick jump-cut to keep
viewers locked in.

Mark a clear turning point. "We bought [Your Product/Service]" and describe the
disciplined work phase. Keep this portion short; the audience only needs to hear that there's
work and to set realistic expectations; Ex: "followed the system to a T. It was hard but worth
it". Switch to upbeat music at the turning point in the ad.

Describe/show the dream outcome with numbers and personal benefits. Ex: the
member surge (31 → 200+), profit jump, kids taken to school, dinners at home—each
positive matched with uplifting B-roll (if you can, if not, words work).

Highlight the speed and ease. Ex: "Hired staff, stepped away in 4.5 months". This
tackles the "too slow/too hard" objection before it forms.

Insert a brief, honest disclaimer. Ex: "It's not easy, but it's completely worth it". The
damaging admission boosts credibility and decreases skepticism.

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION

=== Page 34 ===
Give a condensed "reason why" to take action. Talent should mirror the prospect's
pain, then paint their bigger dream (freedom, legacy, community impact). Let the customer
speak directly to camera so prospects feel the invitation is personal.

End with one crystal-clear CTA on screen. Plus add in voice-over. Ex: "Download
the 11 frameworks we used to build million-dollar gyms". Use a bold number hook and a
button graphic so the next step is clear.

Remember the narrative rhythm. PERSONAL STAKES → PERSONAL PAIN
→ PROFESSIONAL PAIN → TURNING POINT → WORK → PROFESSIONAL
GOOD → PERSONAL GOOD → ADDRESS SKEPTICISM → REASON WHY→ CTA.
Follow that sequence and you'll do just fine.

Ad Framework #4 Show Don't Tell

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
I discovered this framework at a time when I was learning more about proof. In short,
the closer a prospector can approximate the proof to their situation, the lower the risk, and by
extension, the more compelling it is. So for example, someone who doesn't look like them,
in a different country, says they own a gym, and that it got full, is far less compelling than
someone who looks like them, down the street, at their gym, with a line out the door they
can see.

I sold “make your gym more profitable”. The way to show that was a packed class. So
I asked my community to send me videos of their most packed times. And... these ads
crushed. I reused this format many many many times. Below was the most successful of that
entire family of ads. And it serves as proof that you don't even need ad copy. Just showing the
result clearly enough can be an ad in and of itself. Proof works better than just about anything
else for persuading people.

Reminder: Ads don't need to be fancy. They need to get people to click.

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION

=== Page 36 ===
Visual Hooks
• Bold red text at top with clear "dream outcome" with high ticket price point.
• Proves the headline by showing a completely full class.
• The visual demonstrates the dream outcome—packed classes. Show not tell.
• Many people moving at once almost always draws attention. (Remember this. It's a
big one. The only thing better than many people moving at once is many people
moving at once in unison). This is a massive pro tip.

Ad Copy: No telling. All showing.

How To Apply This Ad Framework:
Show the outcome happening instead of saying it happened. Ask current customers
who match your target avatar to film their "dream outcome proof moment". The more the
ad show viewers' own dream outcome, the lower the perceived risk. Ex: Don't say you can
get their phone to ring off the hook, show their packed calendars. Don't say you can fill their
gym, show them what their gym could look like—show them a line around the block. Don't say
you fix their credit—show them reacting to paying off their last loan and getting a card in the
mail with 10x their old limit. Etc.

Frame what they're looking at. Use the fewest possible words and numbers to frame
what they're looking at immediately. We don't want them to have to figure out. Do this in
post production. Use a high-contrast color to grab their eye.

Get people to move in unison if possible. We pay attention when we see lots of
humans doing the same stuff at the same time. Think synchronized swimming, flash mobs,
cheerleading teams. We can't help but stare. This stops the scroll far better than narration
ever can. This is a massive pro tip that people will skip over. This ad only shows many people
moving, but not in unison. If it were in unison—it would be even better.

Proof does the talking. The proof should be so clear you don't need to add narration
(if possible). If you have to use words for people to know what it means, you'll have a less
effective ad. Not to say it won't work, but if you can demonstrate it without words it'll work
that much better. Also, a fun side benefit of this style is that non-verbal clips also tend to get
more reach organically.

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION

=== Page 37 ===
Non-verbal ads need non-verbal CTAs. For this type of ad, there are no words, so
make sure you add a visual CTA that works without narration/speaking. The ad shows them
"This could be you" and the button tells them what to do next.

Ad Framework #5 Long Term Result

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
This is one of my top ad frameworks from a family of ads I called "the one year later
campaign". Basically, I contrast my results against the "one trick ponies" in my industry.
They're all talking about small results in short timelines. I want to show bigger results on
longer timelines. It shows we're legit. When I discovered these, I didn't realize it would
become our most successful campaign (in aggregate) of all time.

By focusing on the numbers that mattered to them, and setting realistic expectations,
it brings in the absolute highest quality customers. These calls and customers cost more to
acquire—but they paid more, stayed longer, got better results, and referred friends.

To be clear, poor beginner customers will absolutely buy "get rich quick" but then you're
only selling to poor beginners. The more advanced your prospect, the more informed they
are. They know it takes time. They know it takes work. They just want to make sure you're
at their level and can help them get to the next one.

Interestingly, when I ran this the first time, the cost per call for this campaign was
higher than our KPIs. I almost turned the campaign off, but my sales team begged me not
to. This campaign taught me an important lesson: don't optimize for CAC, optimize for
LTV:CAC. This type of ad doesn't optimize for cheap leads, it optimizes for big spenders.
Said differently, you can get $100 customers who pay you $200 or you can get $1,000
customers that pay you $10,000. They'll cost more but you'll make more.

This style also taught me to make ads that don't just attract your genre of customer (any
gym owner), but the exact customer you want (advanced gym owner). And the easiest way to
do that is talk about the things those customers care about. So be specific. Use language that
only the upper echelon of customers would understand.

For the most part, you'll get the upper market and the smaller market. But only talking
to a beginner never gets the advanced guy. And besides, no one else will talk to the advanced
customer because they're afraid to ostracize any customers. So it's ripe for the taking.

• The avatar in their place of work: A gym owner, in a gym. Again. It's so simple, and
yet few do it.
• A whiteboard with reference numbers creates more proof and believability.
• This attracts a more affluent gym owner. NOT a struggling gym—but average gyms
that want to become great gyms.
• Headline shows a wild before and after 93→321 and includes client lifespan (not a
normal discussion for beginners in this industry).

Ad Copy:
Hook
My profit was $0. I had a few part-time people helping me out. I was working 60 plus hours
a week. (PAIN HOOK)

Meat/Offer
At that point. We were really struggling and failing business (PAIN), um, and really just
running on my passion. Uh, and I really was not able to see a path towards a future in small
business, uh, particularly with gyms. (PAIN)

Uh, for myself and my family, we joined Gym Launch, uh, in March of 2017 (DECISION).
Within the first few months, we had tripled revenue. Now we've grown it through the
techniques, and we've learned from Alex and Gym Launch (GUIDE) to over $83,000
a month (EXTERNAL GOOD STUFF). Went from 93, uh, members that were leaving
pretty quickly to now. We have 321 members (EXTERNAL GOOD STUFF), uh, as of this
month, and we're right 400 by spring, and we've got an attrition of under 2%, uh, every
single month. (EXTERNAL GOOD STUFF)

Last year, I've got six full-time people who all make over 40, $45,000 a year as much as
$75,000 a year. (INTERNAL GOOD STUFF - took pride in paying people)

CTA
Thank you, Gym Launch. Thank you Alex and Leila. Uh, and I look forward to, uh, you
know, joining mid meeting, more of you in the, the Gym Launch group as we, as we go.
(CTA)

How To Apply This Ad Framework:
Open with a visual that matches the avatar plus wild before/after headline. Film
your ideal customer in their own workspace (chef in the kitchen, contractor on-site, founder
at the desk). Show a bold industry specific on-screen stat like "Revenue $0 → $83K" and/or
"Users 93 → 321 (12-mo lifespan)."

Hook with a single pain sentence. Lead off camera: "My profit was zero and I was
working 60-hour weeks." One line is enough to make the right prospect think, that's me.

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION

=== Page 42 ===
Stack two to three more specific pains. Ex: Mention hours, cash burn, family pressure—
details only an advanced avatar would relate to. More advanced prospects will lean in when
the struggle sounds exactly like theirs. Pain always works. But the pain has to be their pain,
not someone else's.

Mark the decision point. Small but important detail: make sure they name your solution
and when they did it ("We joined in March 2023"). The timestamp increases credibility by
a lot.

Show new wins—the Fast Win and the Big Win. Ex: Fast Win: "Within three months
we tripled revenue." Big Win: "Today we clear $83k/month with <2 % churn." Two tiers
show both quick payoff and long-term climb. You want both.

Add more detail to further prove the initial claim. Display metrics only advanced
people would understand that would be aligned with the larger proof (revenue/growth)—
LTV, churn, margin, head count, salaries, etc. The deeper the metric, the more advanced the
avatar you attract.

Don't forget life improvements and "soft" benefits. "Six full-time staff now earn
$45–75k; I take my kids to school every day." Human outcomes make the financials
feel real—and the prospect feel better. It'll also cover both types of avatars—some people
genuinely want the "soft stuff" more, others want the "money stuff," so covering both angles
in the ad gets you both types of avatars.

Reason why CTA. Have the spokesperson/testimonial restate the hook and tie the
outcome to the call to action. A simple "Thanks to [you/product], excited to meet more of
you inside" works as an implicit CTA. Massive tip: Advanced prospects respond better to
peer endorsement than you. Get them to make the invitation to them if you can.

SECTION II: MY BEST ALAN AD FRAMEWORKS
Ad Framework #1 Looking For 5 Avatars...

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
"I'm looking for # AVATARS who are looking to DREAM OUTCOME."
This is one of the most classic direct response ads of all time. It works in any niche. It
worked 70 years ago. It works today. It'll likely work tomorrow. When I launch something
new, I'll almost always start with an ad like this.

This also works great for organic audience. To make it more effective, you can also
mention who you aren't looking for. Be as specific as possible—it'll further increase credibility.

On top of that, what takes these ads to the next level is a compelling reason why. For
mine, I wanted to dominate other niches. And that made sense. So, that was the angle. Use
these if you are just starting to run paid ads or monetize your audience. Simple and brutally
effective. To further prove the point, below is an ad from my gym days I dug up using the
same template. It's a simple image with the copy. The second is the ALAN top performer—
and the one I'll breakdown fully in this chapter.

Hook
If you are a local lead gen agency that markets for one single niche and is doing $15,000
a month or more in recurring revenue (CALL OUT) and is trying to get to a hundred
thousand a month, 250 a month, 500, a million plus per month in one niche, (DREAM
OUTCOME) then I have something very special for you. So right now I'm looking for five
agencies that I can help do exactly that. (HOOK)

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION

=== Page 47 ===
Meat/Offer
And the difference between what I'm trying to do and probably everything else you
see is that. Most people in the marketplace that help agencies made their money helping
agencies, they didn't actually make their money dominating a niche. (OLD WAY/OTHER
GUYS) So to date, we are 98-and-a-half million dollars in revenue in a single niche of
gyms in our other business. (US/PROOF)

And so I'm looking for for people who want to actually do that and learn than from somebody
who's actually done it. That being said, my goal here is not to sell a thousand people a 10k
course. That's just not my game. (US VS. THEM) What I'm trying to do is find a handful
of high value partners that I can align with and make my one irresistible offer for you, which
is if we make a ton of money together, you make a lot of money, I make a lot of money, but
if what I help you within your business doesn't make you a red cent, then I don't get paid.
(OFFER)

Fair enough. If that sounds interesting to you. Then what I'd like you to do is click the link,
apply (CTA) and then my executive assistant or someone on my team is actually gonna reach
out and first qualify just to make sure that you actually meet those requirements (NEXT
STEPS) that I just said. Um, but then if it works as a partnership, then we'll be able to
align and I'll give you everything in my arsenal to help you scale very quickly. (DREAM
OUTCOME + SPEED)

CTA
All right, and so anyways, if that sounds interesting to you, then this is for you. Click the
link, apply, and can't wait to meet you. (CTA 2)

How To Apply This Framework:
Film in an educational setting. Think chalkboard, whiteboard, digital screen, or
anything connected to learning. The "teacher" visual signals authority and works best for
complex, novel, or higher ticket offers.

Open with the one-liner. "I'm looking for five (AVATAR) who are looking
(OUTCOME) but don't want to (BIGGEST PAIN POINT) so that I can (REASON
WHY). Here's my (PROOF). If interested, (KEEP WATCHING)."

Explain why you're only taking limited clients. It can be "to get great case studies" or
"to prove my stuff works" or "because we're new to the area" or "because I'm starting out and
will do everything I can to win" etc. No matter what you choose, make it believable. I prefer
the truth (ha).

Why your thing is better than what's out there. The difference should elevate your
product/service. You'll underline this with proof.

Split risk with the customer. Promise to win with them and have some element of
performance compensation; this decreases risk, shows intent to deliver, and attracts
more people.

Send them to your assistant. Ex: "Click the link, apply, and my EA will call to confirm
you fit the requirements." Mentioning my executive assistant further reinforced my authority
and the authenticity of the ad.

Ad Framework #2: New vs. Old

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
It's a classic ADucational framework. You see these a lot, but few do them well. It works
especially well with more advanced/complex products or services. It also has the side benefit
of turning you into a de facto authority in your space over a long enough time horizon. So
these ad types both build brand and drive sales. A great combo.

Marketing and sales have the same objective, they simply operate in different media
(one to one vs. one to many). The goal is to educate the prospect enough to make a decision.
ADucational ads can do a lot of heavy lifting, especially if you have something brand new.

If you're brand new these work great because you'll be judged based on the quality of the
information, not a pre-existing brand. And if you're established, it works even better.

Visual Hooks:
• Man in front of whiteboard = educational = value
• Think of this as "educational"

Ad Copy:
Hook
Lead gen agency owners for local businesses. (CALL OUT) What I wanna show you in
the next couple seconds is how we went from retainer clients at $1,500 a month in the
gym niche to performance clients at $15,000 a month in the same niche, meaning we took
$1,500 a month clients and turned them into $15,000 a month by going from retainer to
performance. (HOOK)

Meat/Offer
And here's how it works. See, the reason that most people don't, can't charge a lot for a
retainer model is that you have what you're charging, which is your price, right? (OLD
WAY) And then you have what they get, which is their value. Simply put, that makes sense.
As long as there's a gap between these two things, everyone is happy because they're getting
more than what they're paying for. (OLD WAY)

The problem is, is that the amount of value that you provide changes over time and the
moment that it dips below what you're charging, this is the moment that they cancel. Right?
(PAIN/PROBLEM) But if you were to reverse this equation and actually make it so that every
single time you charge them for something, this value always existed. (OPPORTUNITY)

Then you'd, in theory, be able to charge them as much as possible. Right, right. (DREAM
OUTCOME) And so that's pretty much what we did. (PROOF) And so we, instead of
saying, Hey, pay us X per month, and you get what you get, you got however many leads you
get, or you get how many people in the door get how many sales. What we did is instead of
charging for service, we instead started charging for shows. (OPPORTUNITY)

And for a brick and mortar business, that is the thing that they want. They want bodies in
the door and they know what a body in the door is worth to them, right? (SPECIFIC) And
so what we did was we said, okay, we're gonna ascribe a value to this number. And so the
question is, let's say it's a hundred dollars per person who walks in the door per person, that's
a person. (EXAMPLE/HYPOTHETICAL PROOF)

Just go with me. It's a hundred dollars per person who walks in the door. How many would
you like? And then all of a sudden you no longer have a cap on the earnings (DREAM
OUTCOME) that you can have per customer, but instead, the customer becomes greedy
and wants to get as many as humanly possible. Think about this. When you have your
retainer model, which is a recurring model, imagine going to a customer at day 30 and
saying, Hey, I'd like you to pay us twice as much.

Probably wouldn't go too well. (SPECIFIC PAIN) but what if you said, Hey, it's day
30, you're within your KPIs. So let's just double your ad spend. They're gonna say, sure.
(OPPORTUNITY) But what ends up happening is that your just doubled the amount of
people that are gonna show up at their facility and therefore how much you can charge.
(DREAM OUTCOME)

And so this is just one of the ways than when we switched from a retainer to a performance
model, oops. Made a lot of videos today (THROWAWAY JOKES). Um, then we switched
from retainer, true performance model. We were able to make a whole bunch more, whatever.
It's somewhere.

CTA
But the point is, is that if you wanna see exactly how this model works, go ahead, click and
then apply. (CTA 1)

And I'll show you exactly how we made this transition and how hundreds of other agencies
are doing it right now, and seeing massive amounts of profit, lower churn, higher amounts
per customer, and ultimately making themselves a much stronger and more competitive
business. So if you're gonna do that, go click, uh, apply, and then we'll see you on the other
side. (CTA 2)

How To Apply This Framework
Film in an educational setting and call out your exact avatar in s five seconds.
Ex: "Local lead-gen agency owners doing about $15k a month—listen up." Why: the
whiteboard signals teaching the label filters for only qualified prospects.

=== Page 52 ===
Make a big claim with details. "We turned $1,500/month clients into $15,000/month
clients–same niche, same leads." Big increase + same context + curiosity.

Attribute all the pain in their life to their outdated model. Be as specific as possible
with the problems they're likely dealing with and attribute all relevant woes to their outdated
model. If the person relates to the old way, and the problems you describe, they'll be hooked
to hear how you solved them.

Reveal the new way and anchor it to a simple metric. Erase the old graph, draw a line,
or turn the page etc. Then rewrite "$100 per show" (or your new unit). Explain your model/
way/method is superior based on this simplified metric.

Drive it home with a case study or hypothetical. Ex: "On day 30 you don't ask for
double the retainer—you just double ad spend. Clients say yes because ROI is already
proven." The math makes the promise believable and serves as a proxy for proof.

Reinforce authority with a single proof line. Ex: "We've generated $98.5 million in
one niche using this switch." One number is enough. Just make it compelling.

Make a risk-reversed offer if possible. Ex: "If you don't make money, I don't get paid."

Finish with a CTA that previews the process. Ex: "Click 'Apply,' my EA will confirm
you qualify, then we'll map your numbers on a 15-minute call." This keeps you elevated
and maintains the frame that this is by application only and that you actually only want
qualified leads.

Close with your hook. You can start with something like this: "I'm looking for five
[AVATAR] doing roughly [CURRENT METRIC] who want [10× OUTCOME] by
swapping their [OLD MODEL] for a [NEW MECHANISM]. We've already produced
[SINGLE PROOF STAT], and if you don't, I don't get paid [RISK REVERSAL].
Click to apply—my team will verify fit and show the math. [QUALIFIED CTA]"

Ad Framework #3: Why You Will Never

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
This ad framework capitalizes on understanding your prospects' problem—and the
solution—better than they do. This leans on expertise. Interestingly, this ad is very similar
to the "Personal Testimonial" ad (the first framework from Section I). But, instead of openlooping how I achieved the outcome despite terrible circumstances... it outlines the terrible
circumstances and explains that they're the reason they haven't achieved their outcome. So it
flips it on its head.

Each added detail keeps "building pressure" with each additional shared statistic/
problem that they probably suffer from. By the end of the ad, the person thinks "man this
guy just named a bunch of stats about my business - and - I'm not at a million dollars a year, he
might be able to help me fix it."

You demonstrate your expertise by how specific or relevant you can describe the problem.
A problem so specific that someone hears it and says “he must be an insider to know this” or
"he must really understand this space" or "I feel like he's describing my life right now". That's
what makes ad and like this effective. This is a personal favorite of mine because of how
flexible it is. But remember... BE SPECIFIC.

This pain/problem-based angle is super repeatable in any niche. List all the problems out
as specifically as you possibly can. Continue to build pressure, then resolve the pressure with
a CTA.

Meat/Offer
And the reason I know this is 'cause we've taken 68 companies over the last four years, over a
million dollars, and on our own company, we've done over a hundred million dollars in sales
in a single niche. (PROOF)

And these patterns repeat themselves over and over and over again. The first is if your lifetime
value per customer is less than $10,000, it'll be very difficult for you to pass a million dollar
per year run rate in your agency (SPECIFIC PAIN/PROBLEM). The second is if your
average revenue per client is less than $2,500 per month. (SPECIFIC PAIN/PROBLEM)

And what I mean by that is if, if you take all of your clients and you take all your revenue
and you divide it out, if your average revenue per client is less than $2,500 per month, it's
very difficult to have enough profit to continue to scale. The third is if your gross margin is
less than 80%. (SPECIFIC PAIN/PROBLEM) Alright, so if you charge a thousand dollars
per month, uh, to a client, and your profit is $500 a month between your creative person, the
account manager, traffic person, et cetera, then your margins are gonna be below 80% and
it's gonna be difficult for you to scale.

And then finally, if your payback period is over 30 days, meaning it takes you more than
30 days with a customer to recover the cost that it costs you to acquire them. (SPECIFIC
PAIN/PROBLEM) So that would be the commission, the ad spend, and any other cost
associated with getting a customer. If it takes you more than 30 days to make that amount
of profit off the customer, you'll be very cash constrained. (SPECIFIC PAIN/PROBLEM).

You won't have enough cash flow to continue to reinvest in ads and continue to market
profitably. (SPECIFIC PAIN). Alright? Now, you may be suffering from one or even all four
of these things, but the good news is there is a model that reverses it and it's not a retainer
model. It's called the reverse royalty model. (OPPORTUNITY)

And I have a seven minute video that breaks down how it, it capitalizes on all four of these
things. Flips 'em to your favor unless you

•  Same Combinations You can do a new prop coupled with a new post-production
effect. You can have new talent say the same script with a new filter or headline. The
combinations give you endless permutations. Once you find a winner, milk it for all
it's got.

Here's the beauty of this—you're putting the most effort into the thing that has the
highest likelihood of winning. This is leverage. You get a higher return on your time.

Next Steps
When starting, run as many ads as you can until you find a winner. As soon as you do,
run it through the Kaleidoscope— and make more winners. 80% of your energy goes into
making Kaleidoscope variations, and the other 20% goes into a totally new ad that beats
the original winners. The Kaleidoscope keeps you competitive now, the new ads keep you
competitive forever. And that's what this is all about.

It's so simple, the only thing simpler is not doing it— which is what most people do— and
get the results most people get: none.

With that being said, Kaleidoscope is about getting more from winners. But, if you
don't have any winners.. I'll let you borrow mine.

PART II: MY ADS BLACKBOOK:
BEST 20 AD FRAMEWORKS
OF ALL TIME

These are the 20 best ad frameworks of all time. I demonstrate my five best frameworks
across four different businesses: Gym Launch, ALAN, Skool, and $100M Leads.

When I called this a Blackbook, I meant it. I refer to this list whenever I make ads today.
Period. In fact, if you're reading these words right now, it proves they work.

I use these ad frameworks across different industries and they still crush. So no matter
what business you're in, you can use these ad frameworks to achieve better results.

I'm going to say this again because someone is gonna say "This ad is for B2B, so it won't
work for me" or "This ad is about making money so it won't apply to my lawncare service".
You're wrong. It will. You just need to replace the blocks with words that describe your
service/product and benefits. Do not think "this won't work for me" think "how can I make
this work for me". Every great entrepreneur I know thinks this way. So you might as well
start now. If you want to test yourself, you should be able to turn every ad into a B2C, B2B,
service, SaaS, or product ad. That's how you'll really know you've "gotten it".

What You'll See for Every Winning Ad Framework
1)   Ad Framework Type
2)   Why This Ad Framework Rocks: how this ad came to be, why I like it, and other
        useful tidbits
3)   Thumbnail + Links So you can watch and see them in action.
4)   Visual Hooks A description of the first three seconds of motion and design that
        stopped the scroll.
5)   Ad Copy: The exact words from the ad. I also include within the copy me breaking
        down what's happening as it's happening (I DO THESE IN ALL CAPS). I find it
        more useful than doing it separately.
6)   How To Apply This Framework: Directions to follow to apply this style and
        structure to advertise whatever you sell. This comes in two parts. The "what to say"
        and the "how to show it". So, you'll also see more visual notes than you're probably
        used to from me. I do this so you can actually make these winners for your business.

What To Do Next
For anyone who needs winners, these frameworks will give you a headstart. For anyone
who already has winners, these will just give you more.

These are the output of tens of millions of dollars and years of iterations. They are my
greatest hits. These ads funded payroll, paid mortgages, and scaled four companies. Now
they're yours. Use them responsibly—preferably to put a dent in your revenue ceiling.

With that said, let's start.

it all...

Ad Framework #1: Personal Testimonial/Origin Story

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
Believe it or not, the first time this ad framework worked, it was with a video I didn't
even intend to be an ad. I made it for an online group I was a part of. I wanted to show how
crazy a particular launch location was. Tons of people in the group said it was cool. Then
one of them told me I should run it as a "meme style ad". I didn't know how to do that, so
she showed me how to put meme style captions on a video. Then, I launched it... and it
took off.

This ad framework functions like one gigantic open loop. The entire ad builds mystery.
But, through building mystery, it also eliminates many of the implied objections that people
have about why something won't work with their gym (location, bad neighborhood, gym size,
price point, age, etc).

It claims a ridiculous compute up front, then shows circumstances that are opposite to
what you'd expect to get that kind of outcome. Then, it keeps expanding on this open loop
by stacking "anti-proof" of the situation until it finally snaps the loop closed or "pays off"
the viewer at the very end with the stack of $500 bills (signed contracts).

Any business can easily think about a situation that would make it less than ideal for
a customer to get an outcome. Show all of those negatives in a row. Then show an insane
outcome to prove your thing works regardless of circumstance.

This works because there was a big promise, fast timeline, and the delivery/setting made
it believable. It eliminates all the reasons someone would say it didn't work for them in the
ad itself with a massive payoff of proof at the end.

This ad, and subsequent framework, took me from broke to not broke. It changed my
life. It also goes to show you that you don't need to be fancy to win. Just use what you've got.

Visual Hooks:

    •	Shaky selfie style ad creates extra movement and looks more social native.

Meat/Offer
So I’m opening this gym in kind of the middle of nowhere. It doesn’t really look like, it’s like a residential kind of neighborhood, kind of sketchy, (DAMAGING ADMISSION) but I wanna show you something (CURIOSITY). So, even though, you know, don’t let your circumstances make you feel like your, uh, uh, like you can’t sell, usually it’s just your pitch.

Um, she’s like, how sketchy does this look right? (CURIOSITY) I do think you’d be sketched out. So people are coming up these stairs, they’re like, oh my God, I’m looking out the window (CURIOSITY). Looks so sketchy. Look at these bars and the windows. Oh my God, what am I getting into? (CURIOSITY) Like, what is this? (CURIOSITY) Like, ah. I’m saying, yeah, this is gonna be a gym. (DAMAGING ADMISSION/RELATABILITY - the entire intro is a combination of curiosity-driven and relatable)

It’s gonna be amazing. Look, we got some stuff here. Here’s a bathroom that I don’t even know. Here’s some stuff. Here’s some stuff. What’s going on? (CURIOSITY) Hold on. So the other side’s like, wait, is it an apartment? (CURIOSITY) I don’t even know. Is it sort of, it’s like in the middle of the living room, there’s some paintings on the wall and this is it, right? (CURIOSITY)

But somehow, here’s the cool part.

These are all 500 bills, so (DREAM OUTCOME/PROOF)

you can sell wherever you want. So, uh, don’t let that stop you.

How To Apply This Ad Framework:

Make a wild promise/claim in the first five seconds. Open with the end result your prospects crave (“We added $42k in 19 days”). Keep it short—no details yet. (The ad does this visually rather than in the copy).

Show yourself in an obviously “wrong” environment. Film in a setting that looks incompatible with the promise (run-down storefront, tiny bedroom office, deserted parking lot, etc). Mention the flaws aloud (bad neighborhood, zero foot traffic, ugly walls, ancient equipment).

Walk the viewer through a rapid “problems tour”. Move the camera and rattle off every objection prospects normally raise: “Too hard to find.” “No fancy decor.” “Prices look crazy high.” “Were brand new / too old / too small.” Each objection is “anti-proof” that keeps curiosity piqued.

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION  25

=== Page 26 ===
Expand the open loop and stack more negatives. Keep revealing fresh reasons success
shouldn't happen here (broken sign, cramped space, outdated website). Let curiosity build.
Offer no resolution yet.
Snap the loop closed with overwhelming proof. End the tour by showing irrefutable,
evidence into the focus: A stack of cash, signed contracts, fully booked calendar. Shopify
dashboard—all tied to the original wild promise/claim. Say one plain sentence that connects
dots ("If we can sell here, you can sell anywhere.").
Deliver the takeaway and soft CTA. Tie the lesson to the prospect's own limiting
belief ("Your results aren't about location—just the pitch"). Invite them to the next step
(download, book a call, start a trial).

SECTION I: MY BEST GYM LAUNCH AD FRAMEWORKS

Ad Framework #2: Prop Comedy

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
I always wanted to make a "Dollar Shave Club" style ad but never had the resources (or
skill). Finally, I had a good enough videographer to do this with. So we scripted the whole
thing out. One phrase at a time. Then tried to pair each phrase with some prop/scene that
was funny and fast moving.
This was an entertaining ad. The music and visuals do a lot of work here. It's clear and to
the point. We taught gyms how to advertise, so our ads had to be good. Our ads were proof
that we knew what we were doing. These types of ads don't try to do too much. The point is
to get the right person to click with the right intent. This accomplishes that.

=== Page 28 ===
Visual Hooks:

• First scene already in the gym, because I'm targeting gym owners. This seems obvious,
and yet so few people ever do it. Your avatar should immediately see the background,
clothing, and spokesperson as "like them" to increase the likelihood they respond.

• Motion on camera (approaching subject), motion on subject (lifting weights).

• Second scene changes within half a second.

Ad Copy:
Hook
Are you a gym owner? (CALL OUT)

Meat/Offer
Do you want high ticket online clients? (DREAM OUTCOME)
Do you want this in as little as 30 days? (SPEED)
It's possible. We're already doing it. (PERCEIVED LIKELIHOOD)

CTA
To find out how you can too, click the link, download the case studies, schedule a call time.
We'll see you on the other side. (CTA)

How Apply This Ad Framework:
Map the value-equation questions. Write three to four "Yes" prompts that hit dream
outcome, speed, ease, and proof. Ex: "Are you a gym owner?" → "Want high-ticket clients in
30 days?" Keep each line three to five seconds max. The last one should be a CTA.
Assign one prop + one mini-setting per line. Make sure the first setting is one your
avatar recognizes so they know it's for them. After that, try and match the prop to the line if
you can. If you can't, just try to make it fun and interesting.
Film each line separately. Shoot all lines in order but as individual clips. Keep talent
centered and moving (step forward, lift prop, spin around).

=== Page 29 ===
Use whip-cuts or camera swings between clips. Finish each clip with a fast pan; start
the next clip continuing that motion. The momentum "drags" viewers forward without
missing a beat. "This is super important for the pace of the ad"

Layer upbeat music with captions. Choose a royalty-free track (found that out the
hard way). Make captions in huge, high-contrast font to match the spoken line.

Finish with a CTA card. Show the CTA with the spokesperson pointing to it. Freezeframe the last card for one full second so they have time to read it and take action. Bonus
points: I learned this later, actually screenshare the page they'll go to and demonstrate opting in
so they know what happens next.

=== Page 30 ===
Ad Framework #3: Emotional Avatar Testimonial

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
This ad framework absolutely CRUSHES. It birthed one of my best ads of all time
(broken down below). We easily ran 100+ variations of this one piece of creative alone. And
they all performed.
This ad features Cale and Maggie who were some of my first Gym Launch customers.
Their lives had obviously changed since using the systems at Gym Launch. They asked if
they could do anything for me in return. I asked them to film a testimonial and gave them
six points to hit: 1) what was life like before personally and 2) professionally. 3) What
skepticism did you have and 4) why did you choose to take action anyways. 5) What was life
after like personally and 6) professionally.
And they knocked it out of the park. I don't think we've had a testimonial outperform
this one in the company's history. Let's break it down so you can use it.

=== Page 31 ===
Visual Hooks

• Visual proof begins showing Cale and Maggie with their gym behind them. Again,
make sure the ideal avatar thinks "this is for me". Cale and Maggie look and talk
like gym owners (because they are). This also—unsurprisingly—brought in more
married couple owners.
• The frame changes within half a second to an extremely empty looking gym and a
sad looking Cale.
• Emotional music is also playing (we remixed dozens of different music variations).

Ad Copy:
Hook
We were two months from shutting our doors. (HOOK)

Meat/Offer
When we started, we had about 31 members (PAIN). We were making about four grand a
month (PAIN). Maggie was pregnant with our second (STAKES). I had actually gone and
gotten another job in order just to literally put food on the table (PAIN). I was working
really long hours, coaching in the morning, going to work (PAIN).
Coaching in the evening wasn't sustainable (PAIN). There was no light at the end of the
tunnel (PAIN). We weren't happy with where we were at (PAIN), and we joined Gym Launch
(TURNING POINT). We buckled down and we followed the system and we followed it
to a T. 18 months later. Um, I haven't coached a class in a year (LESS BAD STUFF). Now
we've gone from 31 members to over 200 easily. (MORE GOOD STUFF)
We're able to take our kids to school in the morning (GOOD STUFF). We're able to be at
home with them at night and make dinner for them (GOOD STUFF), go to their gymnastics
or soccer (GOOD STUFF). We literally went from being every day in our gym to hiring a
full staff and being able to step away in four and a half months. (FAST BAD TO GOOD
STUFF)
It's not easy, but it's completely worth it. (DAMAGING ADMISSION)
And I would encourage any gym owner that's sitting there on the verge and they're, they're
tired of what they're doing (CALL OUT). They wanna help more people and they wanna
have more freedom in their life, spend more time with their family, and really create a

=== Page 32 ===
legacy, um, in their community (DREAM OUTCOME). And personally to join Alex
and Leila because I absolutely adored our life, um, both personally (INTERNAL
TRANSFORMATION) as well as, uh, financially (EXTERNAL STATUS) and also helped
us teach more people in our community, which is ultimately what we started a gym for.
(INTERNAL TRANSFORMATION + EXTERNAL STATUS)
CTA
There's a better way to build a gym, download these 11 frameworks that we use to build
million dollar gyms (CTA).
How To Apply This Ad Framework:
Pick a client and record them in a setting that communicates that they're like your
avatar visually. This instantly signals "for gym owners" and, by showing both spouses fit
and present, pulls in married-owner prospects.
Show sad setting fast. Cut within half a second to an empty, gloomy shot of the same
setting and add a gentle, emotional soundtrack. The visual contrast plus music sets the
mood for hardship before words are spoken.
Open with a blunt pain statement. "We were two months from shutting our doors"
then stack five-to-six rapid-fire pains and stakes. Ex: low member count, tiny revenue,
pregnancy, second job, and crushing work hours—each line a quick jump-cut to keep
viewers locked in.
Mark a clear turning point. "We bought [Your Product/Service]" and describe the
disciplined work phase. Keep this portion short; the audience only needs to hear that there's
work and to set realistic expectations: Ex: "followed the system to a T. It was hard but worth
it." Switch to upbeat music at the turning point in the ad.
Describe/show the dream outcome with numbers and personal benefits. Ex: the
member surge (31 → 200+), profit jump, kids taken to school, dinners at home—each
positive matched with uplifting B-roll (if you can, if not, words work).
Highlight the speed and ease. Ex: "Hired staff, stepped away in 4.5 months". This
tackles the "too slow/too hard" objection before it forms.
Insert a brief, honest disclaimer. Ex: "It's not easy, but it's completely worth it". The
damaging admission boosts credibility and decreases skepticism.

=== Page 33 ===
Give a condensed "reason why" to take action. Talent should mirror the prospect's
pain, then pair their bigger dream (freedom, legacy, community impact). Let the customer
speak directly to camera so prospects feel the invitation is personal.
End with one crystal-clear CTA on screen. Plus add in voice-over. Ex: "Download
the 11 frameworks we used to build million-dollar gyms". Use a bold number hook and a
button graphic so the next step is clear.
Remember the narrative rhythm. PERSONAL STAKES → PERSONAL PAIN →
PROFESSIONAL PAIN → TURNING POINT → WORK → PROFESSIONAL
GOOD → PERSONAL GOOD → ADDRESS SKEPTICISM → REASON WHY→ CTA.
Follow that sequence and you'll do just fine.

Ad Framework #4 Show Don't Tell

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
I discovered this framework at a time when I was learning more about proof. In short,
the closer a prospector can approximate the proof to their situation, the lower the risk, and by
extension, the more compelling it is. So for example, someone who doesn't look like them,
in a different country, says they own a gym, and that it got full, is far less compelling than
someone who looks like them, down the street, at their gym, with a line out the door they
can see.
I sold "make your gym more profitable". The way to show that was a packed class. So
I asked my community to send me videos of their most packed times. And... these ads
crushed. I reused this format many many times. Below was the most successful of that
entire family of ads. And it serves as proof that you don't even need ad copy. Just showing the
result clearly enough can be an ad in and of itself. Proof works better than just about anything
else for persuading people.
Reminder: Ads don't need to be fancy. They need to get people to click.

=== Page 35 ===
Visual Hooks
• Bold red text at top with clear "dream outcome" with high ticket price point.
• Proves the headline by showing a completely full class.
• The visual demonstrates the dream outcome—packed classes. Show not tell.
• Many people moving at once almost always draws attention. (Remember this. It's a
big one. The only thing better than many people moving at once is many people
moving at once in unison). This is a massive pro tip.
Ad Copy: No telling. All showing.
How To Apply This Ad Framework:
Show the outcome happening instead of saying it happened. Ask current customers
who match your target avatar to film their "dream outcome proof moment". The more the
ad show viewers' own dream outcome, the lower the perceived risk. Ex: Don't say you can
get their phone to ring off the hook, show their packed calendars. Don't say you can fill their
gym, show them what their gym could look like—show them a line around the block. Don't say
you fix their credit—show them reacting to paying off their last loan and getting a card in the
mail with 10x their old limit. Etc.
Frame what they're looking at. Use the fewest possible words and numbers to frame
what they're looking at immediately. We don't want them to have to figure out. Do this in
post production. Use a high-contrast color to grab their eye.
Get people to move in unison if possible. We pay attention when we see lots of
humans doing the same stuff at the same time. Think synchronized swimming, flash mobs,
cheerleading teams. We can't help but stare. This stops the scroll far better than narration
ever can. This is a massive pro tip that people will skip over. This ad only shows many people
moving, but not in unison. If it were in unison—it would be even better.
Proof does the talking. The proof should be so clear you don't need to add narration
(if possible). If you have to use words for people to know what it means, you'll have a less
effective ad. Not to say it won't work, but if you can demonstrate it without words it'll work
that much better. Also, a fun side benefit of this style is that non-verbal clips also tend to get
more reach organically.

=== Page 36 ===
Non-verbal ads need non-verbal CTAs. For this type of ad, there are no words, so
make sure you add a visual CTA that works without narration/speaking. The ad shows them
"This could be you" and the button tells them what to do next.

Ad Framework #5 Long Term Result

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
This is one of my top ad frameworks from a family of ads I called "the one year later
campaign". Basically, I contrast my results against the "one trick ponies" in my industry.
They're all talking about small results in short timelines. I want to show bigger results on
longer timelines. It shows we're legit. When I discovered these, I didn't realize it would
become our most successful campaign (in aggregate) of all time.
By focusing on the numbers that mattered to them, and setting realistic expectations,
it brings in the absolute highest quality customers. These calls and customers cost more to
acquire—but they paid more, stayed longer, got better results, and referred friends.
To be clear, poor beginner customers will absolutely buy "get rich quick" but then you're
only selling to poor beginners. The more advanced your prospect, the more informed they
are. They know it takes time. They know it takes work. They just want to make sure you're
at their level and can help them get to the next one.
Interestingly, when I ran this the first time, the cost per call for this campaign was
higher than our KPIs. I almost turned the campaign off, but my sales team begged me not
to. This campaign taught me an important lesson: don't optimize for CAC, optimize for
LTV:CAC. This type of ad doesn't optimize for cheap leads, it optimizes for big spenders.
Said differently, you can get $100 customers who pay you $200 or you can get $1,000
customers that pay you $10,000. They'll cost more but you'll make more.
This style also taught me to make ads that don't just attract your genre of customer (any
gym owner), but the exact customer you want (advanced gym owner). And the easiest way to
do that is talk about the things those customers care about. So be specific. Use language that
only the upper echelon of customers would understand.
For the most part, you'll get the upper market and the smaller market. But only talking
to a beginner never gets the advanced guy. And besides, no one else will talk to the advanced
customer because they're afraid to ostracize any customers. So it's ripe for the taking.

=== Page 40 ===
Visual Hook:
• The avatar in their place of work: A gym owner, in a gym. Again. It's so simple, and
yet few do it.
• A whiteboard with reference numbers creates more proof and believability.
• This attracts a more affluent gym owner. NOT a struggling gym—but average gyms
that want to become great gyms.
• Headline shows a wild before and after 93→321 and includes client lifespan (not a
normal discussion for beginners in this industry).

My profit was $0. I had a few part-time people helping me out. I was working 60 plus hours
a week. (PAIN HOOK)

At that point. We were really struggling and failing business (PAIN), um, and really just
running on my passion. Uh, and I really was not able to see a path towards a future in small

know, joining mid meeting, more of you in the, the Gym Launch group as we, as we go.
(CTA)

=== Page 42 ===
Stack two to three more specific pains. Ex: Mention hours, cash burn, family pressure—
details only an advanced avatar would relate to. More advanced prospects will lean in when
the struggling sounds exactly like theirs. Pain always works. But the pain has to be their pain,
not someone else's.
Mark the decision point. Small but important detail: make sure they name your solution
and when they did it ("We joined in March 2023"). The timestamp increases credibility by
a lot.
Show new wins—the Fast Win and the Big Win. Ex: Fast Win: "Within three months
we tripled revenue." Big Win: "Today we clear $83k/month with <2 % churn." Two tiers
show both quick payoff and long-term climb. You want both.
Add more detail to further prove the initial claim. Display metrics only advanced
people would understand that would be aligned with the larger proof (revenue/growth)—
LTV, churn, margin, head count, salaries, etc. The deeper the metric, the more advanced the
avatar you attract.
Don't forget life improvements and "soft" benefits. "Six full-time staff now earn
$45-75k; I take my kids to school every day." Human outcomes make the financials
feel real—and the prospect feel better. It'll also cover both types of avatars—some people
genuinely want the "soft stuff" more, others want the "money stuff," so covering both angles
in the ad gets you both types of avatars.
Reason why CTA. Have the spokesperson/testimonial restate the hook and tie the
outcome to the call to action. A simple "Thanks to [you/product], excited to meet more of
you inside" works as an implicit CTA. Massive tip: Advanced prospects respond better to
peer endorsement than you. Get them to make the invitation to them if you can.

SECTION II: MY BEST ALAN AD FRAMEWORKS

Inside this section I'll give you my five best ALAN ad frameworks. I break them down
in the following order:
1) Looking for 5
2) New vs. Old
3) Why You Will Never
4) The "North Star"
5) No BS Selfie
Let's start with the first...

=== Page 46 ===
Ad Framework #1 Looking For 5 Avatars...

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
"I'm looking for # AVATARS who are looking to DREAM OUTCOME."
This is one of the most classic direct response ads of all time. It works in any niche. It
worked 70 years ago. It works today. It'll likely work tomorrow. When I launch something
new, I'll almost always start with an ad like this.
This also works great for organic audience. To make it more effective, you can also
mention who you aren't looking for. Be as specific as possible—it'll further increase credibility.
On top of that, what takes these ads to the next level is a compelling reason why. For
mine, I wanted to dominate other niches. And that made sense. So, that was the angle. Use
these if you are just starting to run paid ads or monetize your audience. Simple and brutally
effective. To further prove the point, below is an ad from my gym days I dug up using the
same template. It's a simple image with the copy. The second is the ALAN top performer—
and the one I'll breakdown fully in this chapter.

=== Page 47 ===
[Image of an ad with 5 agency owners]

Visual Hook:
• Man in front of whiteboard = educational = value
• Think of this as "educational"
• An educational setting works better with more complex products

Ad Copy:
Hook
If you are a local lead gen agency that markets for one single niche and is doing $15,000
a month or more in recurring revenue (CALL OUT) and is trying to get to a hundred
thousand a month, 250 a month, 500, a million plus per month in one niche, (DREAM
OUTCOME) then I have something very special for you. So right now I'm looking for five
agencies that I can help do exactly that. (HOOK)

=== Page 48 ===
Meat/Offer
And the difference between what I'm trying to do and probably everything else you
see is that. Most people in the marketplace that help agencies made their money helping
agencies, they didn't actually make their money dominating a niche. (OLD WAY/OTHER
GUYS) So to date, we are or 28-and-a-half million dollars in revenue in a single niche of
gyms in our other business. (US/PROOF)
And so I'm looking for the people who want to actually do that and learn than from somebody
who's actually done it. That being said, my goal here is not to sell a thousand people 10k
courses. That's just not my game. (US VS. THEM) What I'm trying to do is find a handful
of high value partners that I can align with and make my one irresistible offer for you, which
is if we make a ton of money together, you make a lot of money, I make a lot of money, but
if what I help you within your business doesn't make you a red cent, then I don't get paid.
(OFFER)
Fair enough. If that sounds interesting to you. Then what I'd like you to do is click the link,
apply (CTA) and then my executive assistant or someone on my team is actually gonna reach
out and first qualify just to make sure that you actually meet those requirements (NEXT
STEPS) that I just said. Um, but then if it works as a partnership, then we'll be able to
align and I'll give you everything in my arsenal to help you scale very quickly. (DREAM
OUTCOME + SPEED)
CTA
All right, and so anyways, if that sounds interesting to you, then this is for you. Click the
link, apply, and can't wait to meet you. (CTA 2)

=== Page 49 ===
How To Apply This Framework:
Explain why you're only taking limited clients. It can be "to get great case studies" or
"to prove my stuff works" or "because we're new to the area" or "because I'm starting out and
will do everything I can to win" etc. No matter what you choose, make it believable. I prefer
the truth (ha).
Why your thing is better than what's out there. The difference should elevate your
product/service. You'll underline this with proof.
Split risk with the customer. Promise to win with them and have some element of
performance compensation; this decreases risk, shows intent to deliver, and attracts
more people.
Send them to your assistant. Ex: "Click the link, apply, and my EA will call to confirm
you fit the requirements." Mentioning my executive assistant further reinforced my authority
and the authenticity of the ad.

=== Page 50 ===
Ad Framework #2: New vs. Old

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
It's a classic ADucational framework. You see these a lot, but few do them well. It works
especially well with more advanced/complex products or services. It also has the side benefit
of turning you into a de facto authority in your space over a long enough time horizon. So
these ad types both build brand and drive sales. A great combo.
Marketing and sales have the same objective, they simply operate in different media
(one to one vs. one to many). The goal is to educate the prospect enough to make a decision.
ADucational ads can do a lot of heavy lifting, especially if you have something brand new.
If you're brand new these work great because you'll be judged based on the quality of the
information, not a pre-existing brand. And if you're established, it works even better.

=== Page 51 ===
Visual Hook:
• Man in front of whiteboard = educational = value
• Think of this as "educational"
• An educational setting works better with more complex products

Ad Copy:
Hook
Lead gen agency owners for local businesses. (CALL OUT) What I wanna show you in
the next couple seconds is how we went from retainer clients at $1,500 a month in the
gym niche to performance clients at $15,000 a month in the same niche, meaning we took
$1,500 a month clients and turned them into $15,000 a month by going from retainer to
performance. (HOOK)

Meat/Offer
And here's how it works. See, the reason that most people don't, can't charge a lot for a
retainer model is that you have what you're charging, which is your price, right? (OLD
WAY) And then you have what they get, which is their value. Simply put, that makes sense.
As long as there's a gap between these two things, everyone is happy because they're getting
more than what they're paying for. (OLD WAY)
The problem is, is that the amount of value that you provide changes over time and the
moment that it dips below what you're charging, this is the moment that they cancel. Right?
(PAIN/PROBLEM) But if you were to reverse this equation and actually make it so that every
single time you charge them for something, this value always existed. (OPPORTUNITY)
Then you'd, in theory, be able to charge them as much as possible. Right, right. (DREAM
OUTCOME) And so that's pretty much what we did. (PROOF) And so we, instead of
saying, Hey, pay us X per month, and you get what you get, you get however many leads you
get, or you get how many people in the door get how many sales. What we did is instead of
charging for service, we instead started charging for shows. (OPPORTUNITY)

=== Page 52 ===
How To Apply This Framework
Make a big claim with details. "We turned $1,500/month clients into $15,000/month
clients—same niche, same leads." Big increase + same context + curiosity.
Attribute all the pain in their life to their outdated model. Be as specific as possible
with the problems they're likely dealing with and attribute all relevant woes to their outdated
model. If the person relates to the old way, and the problems you describe, they'll be hooked
to hear how you solved them.
Reveal the new way and anchor it to a simple metric. Erase the old graph, draw a line,
or turn the page etc. Then rewrite "$100 per show" (or your new unit). Explain your model/
way/method is superior based on this simplified metric.
Drive it home with a case study or hypothetical. Ex: "On day 30 you don't ask for
double the retainer—you just double ad spend. Clients say yes because ROI is already
proven." The math makes the promise believable and serves as a proxy for proof.
Reinforce authority with a single proof line. Ex: "We've generated $98.5 million in
one niche using this switch." One number is enough. Just make it compelling.
Make a risk-reversed offer if possible. Ex: "If you don't make money, I don't get paid."
Finish with a CTA that previews the process. Ex: "Click 'Apply,' my EA will confirm
you qualify, then we'll map your numbers on a 15-minute call." This keeps you elevated
and maintains the frame that this is by application only and that you actually only want
qualified leads.
Close with your hook. You can start with something like this: "I'm looking for five
[AVATAR] doing roughly [CURRENT METRIC] who want [10× OUTCOME] by
swapping their [OLD MODEL] for a [NEW MECHANISM]. We've already produced
[SINGLE PROOF STAT], and if you don't, I don't get paid [RISK REVERSAL].
Click to apply—my team will verify fit and show the math. [QUALIFIED CTA]"

=== Page 53 ===
Ad Framework #3: Why You Will Never

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
This ad framework capitalizes on understanding your prospects' problem—and the
solution—better than they do. This leans on expertise. Interestingly, this ad is very similar
to the "Personal Testimonial" ad (the first framework from Section I). But, instead of openlooping how I achieved the outcome despite terrible circumstances... it outlines the terrible
circumstances and explains that they're the reason they haven't achieved their outcome. So it
flips it on its head.
Each added detail keeps "building pressure" with each additional shared statistic/
problem that they probably suffer from. By the end of the ad, the person thinks "man this
guy just named a bunch of stats about my business - and - I'm not at a million dollars a year, he
might be able to help me fix it."
You demonstrate your expertise by how specific or relevant you can describe the problem.
A problem so specific that someone hears it and says "he must be an insider to know this" or
"he must really understand this space" or "I feel like he's describing my life right now". That's
what makes ad and like this effective. This is a personal favorite of mine because of how
flexible it is. But remember... BE SPECIFIC.
This pain/problem-based angle is super repeatable in any niche. List all the problems out
as specifically as you possibly can. Continue to build pressure, then resolve the pressure with
a CTA.

Ad Copy:
Hook
Agency owners (CALL OUT), I wanna show you the four warning signs your agency will
never pass a million dollars per year. (HOOK)

=== Page 55 ===
Meat/Offer
And the reason I know this is 'cause we've taken 68 companies over the last four years, over a
million dollars, and on our own company, we've done over a hundred million dollars in sales
in a single niche. (PROOF)
And these patterns repeat themselves over and over and over again. The first is if your lifetime
value per customer is less than $10,000, it'll be very difficult for you to pass a million dollar
per year run rate in your agency (SPECIFIC PAIN/PROBLEM). The second is if your
average revenue per client is less than $2,500 per month. (SPECIFIC PAIN/PROBLEM)
And what I mean by that is if, if you take all of your clients and you take all your revenue
and you divide it out, if your average revenue per client is less than $2,500 per month, it's
very difficult to have enough profit to continue to scale. The third is if your gross margin is
less than 80%. (SPECIFIC PAIN/PROBLEM) Alrighty, so if you charge a thousand dollars
per month, uh, to a client, and your profit is $500 a month between your creative person, the
account manager, traffic person, et cetera, then your margins are gonna be below 80% and
it's gonna be difficult for you to scale.
And then finally, if your payback period is over 30 days, meaning it takes you more than
30 days with a customer to recover the cost that it costs you to acquire them. (SPECIFIC
PAIN/PROBLEM) So that would be the commission, the ad spend, and any other cost
associated with getting a customer. If it takes you more than 30 days to make that amount
of profit off the customer, you'll be very cash constrained. (SPECIFIC PAIN/PROBLEM).
You won't have enough cash flow to continue to reinvest in ads and continue to market
profitably. (SPECIFIC PAIN). Alright? Now, you may be suffering from one or even all four
of these things, but the good news is there is a model that reverses it and it's not a retainer
model. It's called the reverse royalty model. (OPPORTUNITY)
And I have a seven minute video that breaks down how it, it capitalizes on all four of these
things. Flips 'em to your favor unless you get way more customers. And at the end of the day,
take home a lot more than that. (LEAD MAGNET/VSL)

=== Page 56 ===
How To Apply This Framework
Begin by standing in front of a whiteboard and addressing your exact avatar in the
first sentence. Ex: "Agency owners, let me show you the four warning signs you'll never
cross $1 million a year." The setting projects authority, and the hyper-specific call-out filters
for qualified prospects.
Establish authority. Ex: "We've taken 68 companies past $1 million and generated
$100 million ourselves." A single, giant credential convinces the audience to keep listening.
Rapid-fire through prospect-specific pains. Ex: LTV under $10k, ARPC under $2.5k,
gross margin below 80%, payback over 30 days. Each number makes owners think, "This
is me."
Introduce your new solution. Ex: "the reverse-royalty model." Name it something
non-obvious. Explain what it is in one sentence and how it inverts all their problems. I had
to come up with "reverse royalty" because "Pay Per Show" was too obvious and killed the
curiosity.
CTA to your lead magnet or Video Sales Letter. If you need the prospect to consume
more information to buy, tell them how. Ex: "Click to opt in, watch a seven-minute demo,
then book a 15-minute qualification call."

=== Page 57 ===
Ad Framework #4: The "North Star"

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
In this framework, I create a "north star" metric. Then I predict their pain point based
on this metric (it can be anything as long as it's predictive). For example, if you know a
man's neck and wrist thickness you can predict their body fat. You need to pick a metric that
does the same for your prospect.
Then, list a series of pain points that resonate with them. Attribute all this pain to their
old way of doing things which causes the north star metric to lag. It explains how all these
dream outcomes aren't achievable for them right now. It lists what they want and explains
why it's out of reach. Then I post that my model can help them and invite them to find out
more.
I want to zero in on something that's always seemed to differentiate my copy from that
of other people—specificity. Instead of explaining, let me show you...
• Members saying the music is too loud while five minutes earlier a member
complained it was too quiet.
• A member complaining that we needed more variety of music right after another
asked me to play the same playlist as last week because they liked it.
• One member requesting clean music with no curse words while another asked
for the real music since the gym is for adults.
• My mic battery dying and having to shout over the music until my voice gave
out.
• Realizing that my members cared more about my playlists than they did about
my workouts.
• Getting a cease and desist for playing my personal playlist over the speakers
because I hadn't licensed the music in a commercial setting.
• iPhones ringing or alarms going off because a trainer plugged their phone in to
play music.
• Commercials in the middle of a song while my gym is going on because a trainer
put their phone on and hadn't paid for premium.

=== Page 58 ===
And all these examples are just about the music in a gym that you might not have
thought about—but if you were a gym owner, you would've. Be specific.
Visual Hook
• Another ADucational video
• If something works, keep doing it--that might be a better meta-lesson than any of
the ad hooks.

Hook
Agencies. (CALLOUT) If you are struggling to break through a plateau and you're struggling
to grow your agency, it's probably not because you don't know how to get customers. It's
cause you probably don't make enough per customer. (HOOK)

Meat/Offer
And now after taking 68 different businesses over a million dollar run rate and taking our
own business over a hundred million dollars in revenue (PROOF), I can tell you that these
patterns repeat themselves over and over and over again.
And so if right now your agency makes less than $5,000 per customer, in terms of total
lifetime value (SPECIFIC PROBLEM). You'll never be able to crack a hundred to $300,000
per year in run rate. You're just never gonna crack it. There's just not enough profit because it
costs X amount to get a customer (SPECIFIC PROBLEM). Alright? Now, as you get better
and you get closer to that $10,000 per customer in lifetime value, how much you make over
the lifespan, then you'll be able to get, you'll be able to crack that million dollars (DREAM
OUTCOME).
And if you're really lucky and you're in a really cheap space, you might be able to squeeze
your way to $3 million a year (DREAM OUTCOME), but you can't do it until you crack
over $10,000. Once you hit 15, then you kind of open up the $3 million plus range you get
from there. And then in really lucky scenarios, like I said, you can get to $10 million a year.
(DREAM OUTCOME)
Alright, but that's where you have a $15,000 LTV or higher. Alright? And then finally, if you
wanna crack that million dollars a month, you wanna get to a million and a half, two million,
two and a half million dollars per month plus (DREAM OUTCOME). And I've done this
two times in my career (PROOF).
And the nice thing is that this single number, your LTV is one of the biggest predictors of how.
Uh, your agency will plateau on how big it will grow. Now, uh, your current model may be a
retainer model, and if you're struggling, you're under 10,000, you're at 8,000, 7,000, 6,000,
et cetera (SPECIFIC PROBLEM). Then I wanna give you a different model that can blow
those numbers outta the water, and it's called a reverse royalty model (OPPORTUNITY).

=== Page 60 ===
CTA
Alright, so if you're interested in that, click uh, opt in, watch the video (CTA 1). And if it
sounds interesting to you, you can apply and schedule a 15-minute call with my team and
we'll see if this model works in your niche. (CTA 2)
Uh, look forward to meeting you and hope you found this valuable.

=== Page 61 ===
How To Apply This Framework:
Start with a direct callout plus a nightmare scenario. Ex: "Agencies, if you're stuck on
a revenue plateau it's probably because you don't make enough per customer." Address the
avatar and their biggest pain in one breath.
Establish authority. One sentence—"We've taken 68 agencies past $1 million and our
own firm has done $100 million in a single niche"—is plenty to establish authority before
attention fades.
List a hierarchy of outcomes based on the metric. Ex: "under $5k and you'll never
crack $300k a year; $10k opens $1 million; $15k unlocks $3 million; $20k+ makes $1
million-a-month realistic." The prospect can identify themselves in the hierarchy.
List specific pains they experience at each level. The narrower your focus, the more
examples there are. Think math. Think moments.
Introduce how your new method solves the north star metric. Keep the explanation
to one clear sentence: billing per result means value always exceeds price, so profit scales
without hitting the old plateaus.
CTA to the next step. Ex: "Opt in to watch a seven-minute video that runs the numbers,
then apply for a 15-minute call so we can test the model in your niche." Detailing the
micro-journey removes friction and positions the call as the obvious release valve for all the
tension you just created.

Ad Framework #5: No BS Selfie

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
This ad framework is very short. First, you can bang a ton of these out with little
effort. Next, you can do them on your own in a bunch of different settings. Beyond that,
constraining your time forces you to limit your words to the only things that matter. These
ads rely on having additional information in the funnel and conversion process. Think of
this as an ad for your lead magnet more than an ad to sell. It sells the next step. Nothing
more. These can work well at the top of the funnel.
Beyond that, I think the camera movement, the house in the background, nice car, and
casual selfie-style did a lot of the heavy lifting... and one of the lines of copy. I'll let you guess
which.

Let the setting do the selling. Open the clip while in motion. Walk and talk with

I have a fancy car and house behind me. Which—in relation to helping businesses grow—
made sense. (Personally - I only did this for a brief stint in my career and I realized I didn't
want that kind of brand - so I stopped. But it is effective).
Start with an if-then pain statement. Ex: "Agency owners, if your LTV hasn't broken
$10k you'll never hit a $1 million run rate." The specificity pulls in the right prospects.
Introduce your solution in one sentence. Ex: "I can show you how to do it with a
reverse-royalty model." Name the solution without explaining it. (We'll let the lead magnet
do that).

=== Page 64 ===
Show proof that someone worse than them got results better than them. Ex: "We've
helped kids in their twenties build $6 million-plus agencies." Age juxtaposition implies that
bigger, older agencies can do even better. This was the line that did the heavy lifting in case
you were curious. I learned this selling weight loss. I used to say our meal plan was "so
easy to use kids and people who couldn't speak English followed it"—before asking if the
prospect could. With that preframe, how could they say no (ha). It makes the prospect think
"If they could do it, so can I."

Section III: My Best Skool Ad Frameworks

Inside this section I'll give you my five best Skool ad frameworks. These generated the
top .1% of ads. I know this because I published over 3,000 over a 10-month sprint. These
five grew the company by many tens of millions in annual recurring revenue. I break them
down in the following order:
1) Trending Format
2) Value Anchor
3) Bribe
4) Underdog
5) Challenge With Prize
Let's start with the first...

Ad Framework #1: Trending Format

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
This ad cruuushes.
Trend ads capitalize on current popular video formats. The example I show emerged
when podcast clips were my entire feed. I had the biggest "duh" moment in life when I
realized—these are popular for a reason, I may as well make my own and use it to sell stuff.
To be clear—the lesson to take from this ad isn't that it was a podcast, it's that it was a
popular video format at the time. This is something I didn't understand when I was a "pure
ads guy". Making organic content has changed the way I see ads—and made me much
better at them.
Organic is way ahead of paid ads because of the volume and speed of testing for
creators. If you want to see where ads will be in six to 12 months, just look at where organic
is today. This is a huge point that will be missed by most.

=== Page 68 ===
Visual Hook:
• "Podcast style"
• Looks like an organic clip
Ad Copy:
Hook
So we launched the Skool Games a little over two weeks ago, and I was surprised at how
much people were making so quickly, (HOOK)
Meat/Offer
like the top 10 people in the games, you know, they're making 10, 20, 30, 40 plus thousand
dollars a month, and that's new revenue. Like they started at zero on the first of the month.
(GOOD STUFF - SPEED)

=== Page 69 ===
And that got me really excited because we believe that we gave all this training and made
the platform super easy and simple that we'd be able to get a lot of people over the hump. I
just didn't understand how many people we were gonna be able to help do it (PERCEIVED
LIKELIHOOD). And so now we have hundreds of people who are making their first dollar
online (PERCEIVED LIKELIHOOD), which is the whole point of all the stuff that I
do now.
I'm even more convicted in promoting the Skool Games, letting people know that I think
it's the easiest way for them to get started online (EASE). And if you've ever been on the
fence or been like, man, I don't know how to do this, or I'm not an expert or I don't have an
audience inside the community (BAD STUFF). There's right now eight different kinds of
models that people are doing all that don't require you to have an audience or be an expert.
(EASE + PERCEIVED LIKELIHOOD)
CTA
And so if you've been on the fence and you haven't been sure what to do, but you do know
that you want to start making money on the internet, you wanna start your first business
online, um, I think this is the best way to do it.

How To Apply This Framework:
Record a solo podcast clip that looks 100% organic. Sit in front of a mic, wear
AirPods, keep jump-cuts and captions exactly the way popular reels do. Viewers should
think they're watching a snippet from your show, not an ad. Alternatively: You can do an
actual podcast where the host feeds you questions you asked them to ask you. And you can
answer with your ad copy. Either work.
Lead with a recent surprising discovery. Ex: Open with "We launched just two weeks
ago and I'm shocked at how fast people are cashing in," so the recency and your genuine
disbelief hook attention.

=== Page 71 ===
PART II: MY ADS BLACKBOOK: BEST 20 AD FRAMEWORKS OF ALL TIME

Stack speed and scaled proof in one line. Ex: "Top 10 are already pulling $10k, $20k,
even $40k a month after starting a zero on the list." Big numbers plus a 30-day window
make the result feel both huge and fast. Note: this ad was targeted at prosumers. If you
want to capture a different segment you'd say different stuff more aligned with their desires
and expectations.
Hammer perceived likelihood and ease by removing every classic objection using
proof. Ex: I explain that hundreds have made their first dollar online and that eight different
no-audience models exist. This crushed the "I don't have an audience objection" and the
"but what if I don't succeed" fear. It also balances the "non-typical" outcomes with the
"everyday" outcomes. Important: I always try to include both big and average outcomes in
my ads. Because people want to know the big thing is possible, but most importantly, want
to understand what's likely.

=== Page 72 ===
Ad Framework #2: Value Anchor

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
I discovered this ad framework during the first batch of ads I recorded to kick off the
Skool Games. And this framework became a clear winner for a while. You may have even
seen it. This fueled the first ever Skool Games.
Things to pay attention to. This is an offer-centric ad. It has two "stacks" that anchor
high then "price drop". First, the hook does this to anchor what someone would be willing
to pay to get their dream business. Most people would pay $1,000—but if you could do it for
free—even better.
The second "stack" and price drop happen once we explain how we help them. Most
people charge $10,000+ for stuff like this, but instead... well do it free.
Then, we add a variable reward in making this "better than free" because not only does
it cost them nothing, they could get something too.
A strong visual and verbal hook + two back to back stacks + strong bonus incentive
create a very compelling ad. This structure could be copied in any niche. It might sound like
this...
How much would you pay for DREAM OUTCOME? $XXX. $XX. $X? —Explain
offer→Anchor value of offer at marketplace rate. ~Give it free/for less than anchor~Add in a lastminute incentive that makes it even better than free. → CTA.

WOULD YOU PAY
Visual Hooks:
• Cash fanned out
• Three-second keyframe in creates immediate motion
• Big red background color
• Text fills the screen repeating the hook
Ad Copy:
Hook
Would you pay a thousand dollars to get the business of your dream in 30 days?
Meat/Offer
Well, how about a hundred dollars to get the business of your dream in 30 days? Well, how
about free?

If that sounds at all interesting, We just launched the Skool Games to help you build and
monetize a community on one platform in 30 days. (BENEFIT)
And this training is the type of stuff that people charge a thousand, $5,000 for, $10,000
(ANCHOR) for, and it's yours. Absolutely free. And to give you one more added incentive,
the top 10 Skools that get built in the 30 days, are gonna fly out to Vegas to spend a full
day with me to help you scale your business from where it is to wherever you want to go.
(MORE GOOD STUFF)

=== Page 74 ===
CTA:
Click the link to join for free, and I'll see you on the other side. (CTA)

How To Apply This Framework:
Open with a scroll-stopping money/prop visual. Film a three-second keyframe of
cash fanned out against a high-contrast backdrop (red works everywhere). Pro Tip: Overlay
oversized text that repeats your first question so even muted viewers grasp the hook before
they can swipe or scroll away.
Make the outcome valuable before you give it away. Free still has costs, this means
you still have to make free valuable. So you anchor the value by asking a series of
descending questions that compare the outcome to some value (money) or another valuable
thing—"Would you pay $1,000? $100? What if it were free?"—to set an initial value in the
viewer's mind and make "free" feel like an unexpected windfall instead of a marketing cliché.
Alternatively: Ask how much it would be worth to make something bad go away. Ex: "How
much would you pay to make your back pain go away?"
Put the dream outcome on a fast timeline. Follow the anchor and price drop with a
one-sentence promise: "Our [product/service] helps you achieve [x] in [duration]."
Make your product/lead magnet valuable before giving it away. Call out real
competitor pricing (Ex: "Most courses cost $1k–$10k") to prove your free offer doesn't suck.
If it's true, it's compelling.
Make it better than free with a variable incentive. Offer an extra incentive (trip,
coaching day, premium tool, etc.) for the top performers/random selection/or everyone.
Point: Turning zero cost into potential gain (at no cost).

Ad Framework #3: Bribe

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
This framework is a monster—fully machined. It came from my first Skool Games shoot:
one brutal day cranking out ~250 ads. Different hooks. Meat. CTAs. Background colors.
Shirts. Pure Mozi volume-and-testing violence. People romanticize random hits, but volume
negates luck. The real winners are built by deliberate work. This ad is no exception. There's
zero magic here.
It's a killer offer-driven ad up front driving to a page that did the heavy lifting. To be
clear—some selling always has to happen.

SECTION I: MY BEST GYM LAUNCH AD FRAMEWORKS

Ad Framework #3: Personal Testimonial/Origin Story

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
Believe it or not, the first time this ad framework worked, it was with a video I didn’t even intend to be an ad. I made it for an online group I was a part of. I wanted to show how crazy a particular launch location was. Tons of people in the group said it was cool. Then one of them told me I should run it as a “meme style ad”. I didn’t know how to do that, so she showed me how to put meme style captions on a video. Then, I launched it… and it took off.

This ad framework functions like one gigantic open loop. The entire ad builds mystery. But, through building mystery, it also eliminates many of the implied objections that people have about why something won’t work with their gym (location, bad neighborhood, gym size, price point, age, etc).

It claims a ridiculous outcome up front, then shows circumstances that are opposite to what you’d expect to get that kind of outcome. Then, it keeps expanding on this open loop by stacking “anti-proof” of the situation until it finally snaps the loop closed or “pays off” the viewer at the very end with the stack of $500 bills (signed contracts).

Any business can easily think about a situation that would make it less than ideal for a customer to get an outcome. Show all of those negatives in a row. Then show an insane outcome to prove your thing works regardless of circumstance.

This works because there was a big promise, fast timeline, and the delivery/setting made it believable. It eliminates all the reasons someone would say it didn’t work for them in the ad itself with a massive payoff of proof at the end.

This ad, and subsequent framework, took me from broke to not broke. It changed my life. It also goes to show you that you don’t need to be fancy to win. Just use what you’ve got.

Visual Hooks
• Visual proof begins showing Cale and Maggie with their gym behind them. Again, make sure the ideal avatar thinks “this is for me”. Cale and Maggie look and talk like gym owners (because they are). This also—unsurprisingly—brought in more married couple owners.

• The frame changes within half a second to an extremely empty looking gym and a sad looking Cale.

• Emotional music is also playing (we remixed dozens of different music variations).

Ad Copy: Hook
We were two months from shutting our doors. (HOOK)

Meat/Offer
When we started, we had about 31 members (PAIN). We were making about four grand a month (PAIN). Maggie was pregnant with our second (STAKES). I had actually gone and gotten another job in order just to literally put food on the table (PAIN). I was working really long hours, coaching in the morning, going to work (PAIN).

Coaching in the evening wasn’t sustainable (PAIN). There was no light at the end of the tunnel (PAIN). We weren’t happy with where we were at (PAIN), and we joined Gym Launch (TURNING POINT). We buckled down and we followed the system and we followed it to a T. 18 months later. Um, I haven’t coached a class in a year (LESS BAD STUFFF). Now we’ve gone from 31 members to over 200 easily. (MORE GOOD STUFF)

We’re able to take our kids to school in the morning (GOOD STUFF). We’re able to be at home with them at night and make dinner for them (GOOD STUFF), go to their gymnastics or soccer (GOOD STUFF). We literally went from being every day in our gym to hiring a full staff and being able to step away in four and a half months. (FAST BAD TO GOOD STUFF)

It’s not easy, but it’s completely worth it. (DAMAGING ADMISSION)

And I would encourage any gym owner that’s sitting there on the verge and they’re, they’re tired of what they’re doing (CALL OUT). They wanna help more people and they wanna have more freedom in their life, spend more time with their family, and really create a

legacy, um, in their community (DREAM OUTCOME). And personally to join Alex and Leila because I wanna transform our life, um, both personally (INTERNAL TRANSFORMATION) as well as, uh, financially (EXTERNAL STATUS) and also helped us teach more people in our community, which is ultimately what we started a gym for. (INTERNAL TRANSFORMATION + EXTERNAL STATUS)

CTA
There’s a better way to build a gym, download these 11 frameworks that we use to build million dollar gyms (CTA).

How To Apply This Ad Framework:
Pick a client and record them in a setting that communicates that they’re like your avatar visually. This instantly signals “for gym owners” and, by showing both spouses fit and present, pulls in married-owner prospects.

Show sad setting fast. Cut within half a second to an empty, gloomy shot of the same setting and add a gentle, emotional soundtrack. The visual contrast plus music sets the mood for hardship before words are spoken.

Open with a blunt pain statement. “We were two months from shutting our doors” then stack five-to-six rapid-fire pains and stakes. Ex: low member count, tiny revenue, pregnancy, second job, and crushing work hours—each line a quick jump-cut to keep viewers locked in.

Mark a clear turning point. “We bought [Your Product/Service]” and describe the disciplined work phase. Keep this portion short; the audience only needs to hear that there’s work and to set realistic expectations: Ex: “followed the system to a T. It was hard but worth it”. Switch to upbeat music at the turning point in the ad.

Describe/show the dream outcome with numbers and personal benefits. Ex: the member surge (31 → 200+), profit jump, kids taken to school, dinners at home—each positive matched with uplifting B-roll (if you can, if not, words work).

Highlight the speed and ease. Ex: “Hired staff, stepped away in 4.5 months”. This tackles the “too slow/too hard” objection before it forms.

Insert a brief, honest disclaimer. Ex: “It’s not easy, but it’s completely worth it”. The damaging admission boosts credibility and decreases skepticism.

PART I: MY ADS BLACKBOOK: BEST 20 AD FRAMEWORKS OF ALL TIME

Give a condensed “reason why” to take action. Talent should mirror the prospect’s pain, then paint their bigger dream (freedom, legacy, community impact). Let the customer speak directly to camera so prospects feel the invitation is personal.

End with one crystal-clear CTA on screen. Plus add in voice-over. Ex: “Download the 11 frameworks we used to build million-dollar gyms”. Use a bold number hook and a button graphic so the next step is clear.

Remember the narrative rhythm. PERSONAL STAKES → PERSONAL PAIN → PROFESSIONAL PAIN → TURNING POINT → WORK → PROFESSIONAL GOOD → PERSONAL GOOD → ADDRESS SKEPTICISM → REASON WHY→ CTA. Follow that sequence and you’ll do just fine.

Ad Framework #4 Show Don’t Tell

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
I discovered this framework at a time when I was learning more about proof. In short, the closer a prospector can approximate the proof to their situation, the lower the risk, and by extension, the more compelling it is. So for example, someone who doesn’t look like them, in a different country, says they own a gym, and that it got full, is far less compelling than someone who looks like them, down the street, at their gym, with a line out the door they can see.

I sold “make your gym more profitable”. The way to show that was a packed class. So I asked my community to send me videos of their most packed times. And… these ads crushed. I reused this format many many times. Below was the most successful of that entire family of ads. And it serves as proof that you don’t even need ad copy. Just showing the result clearly enough can be an ad in and of itself. Proof works better than just about anything else for persuading people.

Reminder: Ads don’t need to be fancy. They need to get people to click.

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION

=== Page 36 ===
Visual Hooks
- Bold red text at top with clear "dream outcome" with high ticket price point.
- Proves the headline by showing a completely full class.
- The visual demonstrates the dream outcome—packed classes. Show not tell.
- Many people moving at once almost always draws attention. (Remember this. It's a
big one. The only thing better than many people moving at once is many people
moving at once in unison). This is a massive pro tip.
Ad Copy: No telling. All showing.

How To Apply This Ad Framework
Show the outcome happening instead of saying it happened. Ask current customers
who match your target avatar to film their "dream outcome proof moment". The more the
ad show viewers' own dream outcome, the lower the perceived risk. Ex: Don't say you can
get their phone to ring off the hook, show their packed calendars. Don't say you can fill their
gym, show them what their gym could look like—show them a line around the block. Don't say
you fix their credit—show them reacting to paying off their last loan and getting a card in the
mail with 10x their old limit. Etc.
Frame what they're looking at. Use the fewest possible words and numbers to frame
what they're looking at immediately. We don't want them to have to figure out. Do this in
post production. Use a high-contrast color to grab their eye.
Get people to move in unison if possible. We pay attention when we see lots of
humans doing the same stuff at the same time. Think synchronized swimming, flash mobs,
cheerleading teams. We can't help but stare. This stops the scroll far better than narration
ever can. This is a massive pro tip that people will skip over. This ad only shows many people
moving, but not in unison. If it were in unison—it would be even better.
Proof does the talking. The proof should be so clear you don't need to add narration
(if possible). If you have to use words for people to know what it means, you'll have a less
effective ad. Not to say it won't work, but if you can demonstrate it without words it'll work
that much better. Also, a fun side benefit of this style is that non-verbal clips also tend to get
more reach organically.

=== Page 37 ===
Non-verbal ads need non-verbal CTAs. For this type of ad, there are no words, so
make sure you add a visual CTA that works without narration/speaking. The ad shows them
"This could be you" and the button tells them what to do next.

=== Page 39 ===
Ad Framework #5 Long Term Result
Why This Ad Framework Rocks
This is one of my top ad frameworks from a family of ads I called "the one year later
campaign". Basically, I contrast my results against the "one trick ponies" in my industry.
They're all talking about small results in short timelines. I want to show bigger results on
longer timelines. It shows we're legit. When I discovered these, I didn't realize it would
become our most successful campaign (in aggregate) of all time.
By focusing on the numbers that mattered to them, and setting realistic expectations,
it brings in the absolute highest quality customers. These calls and customers cost more to
acquire—but they paid more, stayed longer, got better results, and referred friends.
To be clear, poor beginner customers will absolutely buy "get rich quick" but then you're
only selling to poor beginners. The more advanced your prospect, the more informed they
are. They know it takes time. They know it takes work. They just want to make sure you're
at their level and can help them get to the next one.
Interestingly, when I ran this the first time, the cost per call for this campaign was
higher than our KPIs. I almost turned the campaign off, but my sales team begged me not
to. This campaign taught me an important lesson: don't optimize for CAC, optimize for
LTV:CAC. This type of ad doesn't optimize for cheap leads, it optimizes for big spenders.
Said differently, you can get $100 customers who pay you $200 or you can get $1,000
customers that pay you $10,000. They'll cost more but you'll make more.
This style also taught me to make ads that don't just attract your genre of customer (any
gym owner), but the exact customer you want (advanced gym owner). And the easiest way to
do that is talk about the things those customers care about. So be specific. Use language that
only the upper echelon of customers would understand.
For the most part, you'll get the upper market and the smaller market. But only talking
to a beginner never gets the advanced guy. And besides, no one else will talk to the advanced
customer because they're afraid to ostracize any customers. So it's ripe for the taking.

=== Page 40 ===
Visual Hook:
- The avatar in their place of work: A gym owner, in a gym. Again. It's so simple, and
yet few do it.
- A whiteboard with reference numbers creates more proof and believability.
- This attracts a more affluent gym owner. NOT a struggling gym—but average gyms
that want to become great gyms.
- Headline shows a wild before and after 93→321 and includes client lifespan (not a
normal discussion for beginners in this industry).

=== Page 41 ===
Ad Copy:
Hook
My profit was $0. I had a few part-time people helping me out. I was working 60 plus hours a week. (PAIN HOOK)

At that point. We were really struggling and failing business (PAIN), um, and really just running on my passion. Uh, and I really was not able to see a path towards a future in small business, uh, particularly with gyms. (PAIN)
Uh, for myself and my family, we joined Gym Launch, uh, in March of 2017 (DECISION). Within the first few months, we had tripled revenue. Now we’ve grown it through the techniques that we’ve learned from Alex and Gym Launch (GUIDED) to over $83,000 a month (EXTERNAL GOOD STUFF). Went from 93, uh, members that were leaving pretty quickly to now. We have 321 members (EXTERNAL GOOD STUFF), uh, as of this month, and we’re about 400 by spring, and we’ve got an attrition of under 2%, uh, every single month. (EXTERNAL GOOD STUFF)
Last year, I’ve got six full-time people who all make over 40, $45,000 a year as much as $75,000 a year. (INTERNAL GOOD STUFF - took pride in paying people)
CTA
Thank you, Gym Launch. Thank you Alex and Leila. Uh, and I look forward to, uh, you know, joining mid meeting, more of you in the, the Gym Launch group as we, as we go. (CTA)

How To Apply This Ad Framework:

Open with a visual that matches the avatar plus what before/after headline. Film your ideal customer in their own workspace (chef in the kitchen, contractor on-site, founder at the desk). Show a bold industry specific on-screen stat like “Revenue $0 → $83k” and/or “Users 93 → 321 (12-mo lifespan).”  

Hook with a single pain sentence. Lead off camera: “My profit was zero and I was working 60-hour weeks.” One line is enough to make the right prospect think, that’s me.

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION

=== Page 42 ===
PART II: MY ADS BLACKBOOK: BEST 20 AD FRAMEWORKS OF ALL TIME

Stack two to three more specific pains. Ex: Mention hours, cash burn, family pressure—details only an advanced avatar would relate to. More advanced prospects will lean in when the struggle sounds exactly like theirs. Pain always works. But the pain has to be their pain, not someone else’s.

Mark the decision point. Small but important detail: make sure they name your solution and when they did it (“We joined in March 2023”). The timestamp increases credibility by a lot.

Show new wins—the Fast Win and the Big Win. Ex: Fast Win: “Within three months we tripled revenue.” Big Win: “Today we clear $83k/month with <2 % churn.” Two tiers show both quick payoff and long-term climb. You want both.

Add more detail to further prove the initial claim. Display metrics only advanced people would understand that would be aligned with the larger proof (revenue/growth)—LTV, churn, margin, head count, salaries, etc. The deeper the metric, the more advanced the avatar you attract.

Don’t forget life improvements and “soft” benefits. “Six full-time staff now earn $45-$75k; I take my kids to school every day.” Human outcomes make the financials feel real—and the prospect feel better. It’ll also cover both types of avatars—some people genuinely want the “soft stuff” more, others want the “money stuff,” so covering both angles in the ad gets you both types of avatars.

Reason why CTA. Have the spokesperson/testimonial restate the hook and tie the outcome to the call to action. A simple “Thanks to you/product], excited to meet more of you inside” works as an implicit CTA. Massive tip: Advanced prospects respond better to peer endorsement than you. Get them to make the invitation to them if you can.

These are all 500 bills, so (DREAM OUTCOME/PROOF)

you can sell wherever you want. So, uh, don’t let that stop you.

How To Apply This Ad Framework:
Make a wild promise/claim in the first five seconds. Open with the end result your prospects crave (“We added $42k in 19 days”). Keep it short—no details yet. (The ad does this visually rather than in the copy.)

Show yourself in an obviously “wrong” environment. Film in a setting that looks incompatible with the promise (run-down storefront, tiny bedroom office, deserted parking lot, etc). Mention the flaws aloud (bad neighborhood, zero foot traffic, ugly walls, ancient equipment).

Walk the viewer through a rapid “problems tour”. Move the camera and rattle off every objection prospects normally raise: “Too hard to find.” “No fancy decor.” “Prices look crazy high.” “Were brand new / too old / too small.” Each objection is “anti-proof” that keeps curiosity piqued.

If you are a local lead gen agency that markets for one single niche and is doing $15,000
a month or more in recurring revenue (CALL OUT) and is trying to get to a hundred
thousand a month, 250 a month, 500, a million plus per month in one niche, (DREAM
OUTCOME) then I have something very special for you. So right now I’m looking for five
agencies that I can help do exactly that. (HOOK)

=== Page 47 ===
Meat/Offer
And the difference between what I’m trying to do and probably everything else that helps
see is that. Most people in the marketplace that help agencies made their money helping
agencies, they didn’t actually make their money dominating a niche. (OLD WAY/OTHER
GUYS) So to dare, we are or 28-and-half million dollars in revenue in a single niche of
gyms in our other business. (US/PROOF)
And so I’m looking for the people who want to actually do that and learn thar from somebody
who’s actually done it. That being said, my goal here is not to sell a thousand people a 10k
course. That’s just not my game. (US VS. THEM) What I’m trying to do is find a handful
of high value partners that I can align with and make my one irresistible offer for you, which
is if we make a ton of money together, you make a lot of money, I make a lot of money, but
if what I help you within your business doesn’t make you a red cent, then I don’t get paid.
(OFFER)
Fair enough. If that sounds interesting to you. Then what I’d like you to do is click the link,
apply (CTA) and then my executive assistant or someone on my team is actually gonna reach
out and first qualify just to make sure that you actually meet those requirements (NEXT
STEPS) that I just said. Um, but then if it works as a partnership, then we’ll be able to
align and I’ll give you everything in my arsenal to help you scale very quickly. (DREAM
OUTCOME + SPEED)

CTA
All right, and so anyways, if that sounds interesting to you, then this is for you. Click the
link, apply, and can’t wait to meet you. (CTA 2)

How To Apply This Framework:
Film in an educational setting. Think chalkboard, whiteboard, digital screen, or
anything connected to learning. The “teacher” visual signals authority and works best for
complex, novel, or higher ticket offers
Open with the one-liner. “I’m looking for five (AVATAR) who are looking
(OUTCOME) but don’t want to (BIGGEST PAIN POINT) so that I can (REASON
WHY). Here’s my (PROOF). If interested, (KEEP WATCHING).”

=== Page 48 ===
Explain why you’re only taking limited clients. It can be “to get great case studies” or
“to prove my stuff works” or “because we’re new to the area” or “because I’m starting out and
will do everything I can to win” etc. No matter what you choose, make it believable. I prefer
the truth (ha).

Why your thing is better than what’s out there. The difference should elevate your
product/service. You’ll underline this with proof.

Split risk with the customer. Promise to win with them and have some element of
performance compensation; this decreases risk, shows intent to deliver, and attracts
more people.

Send them to your assistant. Ex: “Click the link, apply, and my EA will call to confirm
you fit the requirements.” Mentioning my executive assistant further reinforced my authority
and the authenticity of the ad.

Ad Framework #2: New vs. Old

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
It’s a classic ADucational framework. You see these a lot, but few do them well. It works
especially well with more advanced/complex products or services. It also has the side benefit
of turning you into a de facto authority in your space over a long enough time horizon. So
these ad types both build brand and drive sales. A great combo.

Marketing and sales have the same objective, they simply operate in different media
(one to one vs. one to many). The goal is to educate the prospect enough to make a decision.
ADucational ads can do a lot of heavy lifting, especially if you have something brand new.

If you’re brand new these work great because you’ll be judged based on the quality of the
information, not a pre-existing brand. And if you’re established, it works even better.

Lead gen agency owners for local businesses. (CALL OUT) What I wanna show you in
the next couple seconds is how we went from retainer clients at $1,500 a month in the
gym niche to performance clients at $15,000 a month in the same niche, meaning we took
$1,500 a month clients and turned them into $15,000 a month by going from retainer to
performance. (HOOK)

Meat/Offer
And here’s how it works. See, the reason that most people don’t, can’t charge a lot for a
retainer model is that you have what you’re charging, which is your price, right? (OLD
WAY) And then you have what they get, which is their value. Simply put, that makes sense.
As long as there’s a gap between these two things, everyone is happy because they’re getting
more than what they’re paying for. (OLD WAY)
The problem is, is that the amount of value that you provide changes over time and the
moment that it dips below what you’re charging, this is the moment that they cancel. Right?
(PAIN/PROBLEM) But if you were to reverse this equation and actually make it so that every
single time you charge them for something, this value always existed. (OPPORTUNITY)
Then you’d, in theory, be able to charge them as much as possible. Right, right. (DREAM
OUTCOME) And so that’s pretty much what we did. (PROOF) And so we, instead of
saying, Hey, pay us X per month, and you get what you get, you get however many leads you
get, or you get how many people in the door get how many sales. What we did is instead of
charging for service, we instead started charging for shows. (OPPORTUNITY)

=== Page 51 ===
And for a brick and mortar business, that is the thing that they want. They want bodies in
the door and they know what a body in the door is worth to them, right? (SPECIFIC) And
so what we did was we said, okay, we’re gonna ascribe a value to this number. And so the
question is, let’s say it’s a hundred dollars per person who walks in the door per person, that’s
a person. (EXAMPLE/HYPOTHETICAL PROOF)
Just go with me. It’s a hundred dollars per person who walks in the door. How many would
you like? And then all of a sudden you no longer have a cap on the numbers (DREAM
OUTCOME) that you can have per customer, but instead, the customer becomes greedy
and wants to get as many as humanly possible. Think about this. When you have your
retainer model, which is a recurring model, imagine going to a customer at day 30 and
saying, Hey, I’d like you to pay us twice as much.
Probably wouldn’t go too well. (SPECIFIC PAIN) but what if you said, Hey, it’s day
30, you’re within your KPIs. So let’s just double your ad spend. They’re gonna say, sure.
(OPPORTUNITY) But what ends up happening is that you just doubled the amount of
people that are gonna show up at their facility and therefore how much you can charge.
(DREAM OUTCOME)
And so this is just one of the ways than when we switched from a retainer to a performance
model, oops. Made a lot of videos today (THROWAWAY JOKES). Um, then we switched
from retainer, true performance model. We were able to make a whole bunch more, whatever.
It’s somewhere.
CTA
But the point is, is that if you wanna see exactly how this model works, go ahead, click and
then apply. (CTA 1)
And I’ll show you exactly how we made this transition and how hundreds of other agencies
are doing it right now, and seeing massive amounts of profit, lower churn, higher amounts
per customer, and ultimately making themselves a much stronger and more competitive
business. So if you’re gonna do that, go click, uh, apply, and then we’ll see you on the other
side. (CTA 2)

How To Apply This Framework
Film in an educational setting and call out your exact avatar in s five seconds.
Ex: “Local lead-gen agency owners doing about $15k a month—listen up.” Why: the
whiteboard signals teaching; the label filters for only qualified prospects.

=== Page 52 ===
Make a big claim with details. “We turned $1,500/month clients into $15,000/month
clients—same niche, same leads.” Big increase + same context + curiosity.

Attribute all the pain in their life to their outdated model. Be as specific as possible
with the problems they’re likely dealing with and attribute all relevant woes to their outdated
model. If the person relates to the old way, and the problems you describe, they’ll be hooked
to hear how you solved them.

Reveal the new way and anchor it to a simple metric. Erase the old graph, draw a line,
or turn the page etc. Then rewrite “$100 per show” (or your new unit). Explain your model/
way/method is superior based on this simplified metric.

Drive it home with a case study or hypothetical. Ex: “On day 30 you don’t ask for
double the retainer—you just double ad spend. Clients say yes because ROI is already
proven.” The math makes the promise believable and serves as a proxy for proof.

Reinforce authority with a single proof line. Ex: “We’ve generated $98.5 million in
one niche using this switch.” One number is enough. Just make it compelling.

Make a risk-reversed offer if possible. Ex: “If you don’t make money, I don’t get paid.”

Finish with a CTA that previews the process. Ex: “Click ‘Apply,’ my EA will confirm
you qualify, then we’ll map your numbers on a 15-minute call.” This keeps you elevated
and maintains the frame that this is by application only and that you actually only want
qualified leads.

Close with your hook. You can start with something like this: “I’m looking for five
[AVATAR] doing roughly [CURRENT METRIC] who want [10x OUTCOME] by
swapping their [OLD MODEL] for a [NEW MECHANISM]. We’ve already produced
[SINGLE PROOF STAT], and if you don’t profit, I don’t get paid [RISK REVERSAL].
Click to apply—my team will verify fit and show the math. [QUALIFIED CTA]”

Ad Framework #3: Why You Will Never

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
This ad framework capitalizes on understanding your prospects’ problem—and the
solution—better than they do. This leans on expertise. Interestingly, this ad is very similar
to the “Personal Testimonial” ad (the first framework from Section I). But, instead of openlooping
how I achieved the outcome despite terrible circumstances… it outlines the terrible
circumstances and explains that they’re the reason they haven’t achieved their outcome. So it
flips it on its head.
Each added detail keeps “building pressure” with each additional shared statistic/
problem that they probably suffer from. By the end of the ad, the person thinks “man this
guy just named a bunch of stats about my business - and - I’m not at a million dollars a year, he
might be able to help me fix it.”
You demonstrate your expertise by how specific or relevant you can describe the problem.
A problem so specific that someone hears it and says “he must be an insider to know this” or
“he must really understand this space” or “I feel like he’s describing my life right now”. That’s
what makes an ad like this effective. This is a personal favorite of mine because of how
flexible it is. But remember… BE SPECIFIC.
This pain/problem-based angle is super repeatable in any niche. List all the problems out
as specifically as you possibly can. Continue to build pressure, then resolve the pressure with
a CTA.

The 4 WARNING SIGNS

Agency owners (CALL OUT), I wanna show you the four warning signs your agency will
never pass a million dollars per year. (HOOK)

=== Page 55 ===
Meat/Offer
And the reason I know this is ’cause we’ve taken 68 companies over the last four years, over a
million dollars, and on our own company, we’ve done over a hundred million dollars in sales
in a single niche. (PROOF)
And these patterns repeat themselves over and over and over again. The first is if your lifetime
value per customer is less than $10,000, it’ll be very difficult for you to pass a million dollar
per year run rate in your agency (SPECIFIC PAIN/PROBLEM). The second is if your
average revenue per client is less than $2,500 per month. (SPECIFIC PAIN/PROBLEM)
And what I mean by that is if, if you take all of your clients and you take all your revenue
and you divide it out, if your average revenue per client is less than $2,500 per month, it’s
very difficult to have enough profit to continue to scale. The third is if your gross margin is
less than 80%. (SPECIFIC PAIN/PROBLEM) Alright, so if you charge a thousand dollars
per month, uh, to a client, and you still make $500 a month between your creative person, the
account manager, traffic person, et cetera, then your margins are gonna be below 80% and
it’s gonna be difficult for you to scale.
And then finally, if your payback period is over 30 days, meaning; it takes you more than
30 days with a customer to recover the cost that it costs you to acquire them. (SPECIFIC
PAIN/PROBLEM) So that would be the commission, the ad spend, and any other cost
associated with getting a customer. If it takes you more than 30 days to make that amount
of profit off the customer, you’ll be very cash constrained. (SPECIFIC PAIN/PROBLEM).
You won’t have enough cash flow to continue to reinvest in ads and continue to market
profitably. (SPECIFIC PAIN). Alright? Now, you may be suffering from one or even all four
of these things, but the good news is there is a model that reverses it and it’s not a retainer
model. It’s called the reverse royalty model. (OPPORTUNITY)
And I have a seven minute video that breaks down how it, it capitalizes on all four of these
things. Flips ’em to your favor unless you get way more customers. And at the end of the day,
take home a lot more than that. (LEAD MAGNET/VSL)

=== Page 56 ===
How To Apply This Framework
Begin by standing in front of a whiteboard and addressing your exact avatar in the
first sentence. Ex: “Agency owners, let me show you the four warning signs you’ll never
cross $1 million a year.” The setting projects authority, and the hyper-specific call-out filters
for qualified prospects.
Establish authority. Ex: “We’ve taken 68 companies past $1 million and generated
$100 million ourselves.” A single, giant credential convinces the audience to keep listening.
Rapid-fire through prospect-specific pains. Ex: LTV under $10k, ARPC under $2.5k,
gross margin below 80%, payback over 30 days. Each number makes owners think, “This
is me.”
Introduce your new solution. Ex: “the reverse-royalty model.” Name it something
non-obvious. Explain what it is in one sentence and how it inverts all their problems. I had
to come up with “reverse royalty” because “Pay Per Show” was too obvious and killed the
curiosity.
CTA to your lead magnet or Video Sales Letter. If you need the prospect to consume
more information to buy, tell them how. Ex: “Click to opt in, watch a seven-minute demo,
then book a 15-minute qualification call.”

Ad Framework #4: The “North Star”

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
In this framework, I create a “north star” metric. Then I predict their pain point based
on this metric (it can be anything as long as it’s predictive). For example, if you know a
man’s neck and wrist thickness you can predict their body fat. You need to pick a metric that
does the same for your prospect.
Then, list a series of pain points that resonate with them. Attribute all this pain to their
old way of doing things which causes the north star metric to lag. It explains how all these
dream outcomes aren’t achievable for them right now. It lists what they want and explains
why it’s out of reach. Then I post that my model can help them and invite them to find out
more.
I want to zero in on something that’s always seemed to differentiate my copy from that
of other people—specificity. Instead of explaining, let me show you...
For example, I could tell you probably a million very specific problems for gyms.
•  Members saying the music is too loud while five minutes earlier a member
complained it was too quiet.
•  A member complaining that we needed more variety of music right after another
asked me to play the same playlist as last week because they liked it.
•  One member requesting clean music with no curse words while another asked
for the real music since the gym is for adults.
•  My mic battery dying and having to shout over the music until my voice gave
out.
•  Realizing that my members cared more about my playlists than they did about
my workouts.
•  Getting a cease and desist for playing my personal playlist over the speakers
because I hadn’t licensed the music in a commercial setting.
•  iPhones ringing or alarms going off because a trainer plugged their phone in to
play music.
•  Commercials in the middle of a song while my gym is going on because a trainer
put their phone on and hadn’t paid for premium.

=== Page 58 ===
And all these examples are just about the music in a gym that you might not have
thought about- but if you were a gym owner, you would’ve. Be specific.

Agencies. (CALLOUT) If you are struggling to break through a plateau and you’re struggling
to grow your agency, it’s probably not because you don’t know how to get customers. It’s
cause you probably don’t make enough per customer. (HOOK)

Meat/Offer
And now after taking 68 different businesses over a million dollar run rate and taking our
own business over a hundred million dollars in revenue (PROOF), I can tell you that these
patterns repeat themselves over and over and over again.
And so if right now your agency makes less than $5,000 per customer, in terms of total
lifetime value (SPECIFIC PROBLEM). You’ll never be able to crack a hundred to $300,000
per year in run rate. You’re just never gonna crack it. There’s just not enough profit because it
costs X amount to get a customer (SPECIFIC PROBLEM). Alright? Now, as you get better
and you get closer to that $10,000 per customer in lifetime value, how much you make over
the lifespan, then you’ll be able to get, you’ll be able to crack that million dollars (DREAM
OUTCOME).
And if you’re really lucky and you’re in a really cheap space, you might be able to squeeze
your way to $3 million a year (DREAM OUTCOME), but you can’t do it until you crack
over $10,000. Once you hit 15, then you kind of open up the $3 million plus range you get
from there. And then in really lucky scenarios, like I said, you can get to $10 million a year.
(DREAM OUTCOME)
Alright, but that’s where you have a $15,000 LTV or higher. Alright? And then finally, if you
wanna crack that million dollars a month, you wanna get to a million and a half, two million,
two and a half million dollars per month plus (DREAM OUTCOME). And I’ve done this
two times in my career (PROOF).
And the nice thing is that this single number, your LTV is one of the biggest predictors of how.
Uh, your agency will plateau on how big it will grow. Now, uh, your current model may be a
retainer model, and if you’re struggling, you’re under 10,000, you’re at 8,000, 7,000, 6,000,
et cetera (SPECIFIC PROBLEM). Then I wanna give you a different model that can blow
these numbers outta the water, and it’s called a reverse royalty model (OPPORTUNITY).

=== Page 59 ===
And if you’re really lucky and you’re in a really cheap space, you might be able to squeeze
your way to $3 million a year (DREAM OUTCOME), but you can’t do it until you crack
over $10,000. Once you hit 15, then you kind of open up the $3 million plus range you get
from there. And then in really lucky scenarios, like I said, you can get to $10 million a year.
(DREAM OUTCOME)
Alright, but that’s where you have a $15,000 LTV or higher. Alright? And then finally, if you
wanna crack that million dollars a month, you wanna get to a million and a half, two million,
two and a half million dollars per month plus (DREAM OUTCOME). And I’ve done this
two times in my career (PROOF).
And the nice thing is that this single number, your LTV is one of the biggest predictors of how.
Uh, your agency will plateau on how big it will grow. Now, uh, your current model may be a
retainer model, and if you’re struggling, you’re under 10,000, you’re at 8,000, 7,000, 6,000,
et cetera (SPECIFIC PROBLEM). Then I wanna give you a different model that can blow
these numbers outta the water, and it’s called a reverse royalty model (OPPORTUNITY).

=== Page 60 ===
How To Apply This Framework
Begin by standing in front of a whiteboard and addressing your exact avatar in the
first sentence. Ex: “Agency owners, let me show you the four warning signs you’ll never
cross $1 million a year.” The setting projects authority, and the hyper-specific call-out filters
for qualified prospects.
Establish authority. Ex: “We’ve taken 68 companies past $1 million and generated
$100 million ourselves.” A single, giant credential convinces the audience to keep listening.
Rapid-fire through prospect-specific pains. Ex: LTV under $10k, ARPC under $2.5k,
gross margin below 80%, payback over 30 days. Each number makes owners think, “This
is me.”
Introduce your new solution. Ex: “the reverse-royalty model.” Name it something
non-obvious. Explain what it is in one sentence and how it inverts all their problems. I had
to come up with “reverse royalty” because “Pay Per Show” was too obvious and killed the
curiosity.
CTA to your lead magnet or Video Sales Letter. If you need the prospect to consume
more information to buy, tell them how. Ex: “Click to opt in, watch a seven-minute demo,
then book a 15-minute qualification call.”

Ad Framework #5: No BS Selfie

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
This ad framework is very short. First, you can bang a ton of these out with little
effort. Next, you can do them on your own in a bunch of different settings. Beyond that,
constraining your time forces you to limit your words to the only things that matter. These
ads rely on having additional information in the funnel and conversion process. Think of
this as an ad for your lead magnet more than an ad to sell. It sells the next step. Nothing
more. These can work well at the top of the funnel.
Beyond that, I think the camera movement, the house in the background, nice car, and
casual selfie-style did a lot of the heavy lifting... and one of the lines of copy. I’ll let you guess
which.

=== Page 62 ===
Visual Hook: Selfie Style
•  Big house in background
•  Selfie style
•  Low-fi
•  Walking with movement

Ad Copy:
Hook
Agency owners, if you can’t crack $10,000 in lifetime value per customer, you’re never gonna
hit the million dollar run rate you want. (HOOK)

Meat/Offer
And I can show you exactly how to do it using a reverse royalty model. (MECHANISM)
And we’ve had $6 million-plus agencies for kids in their twenties. (PROOF)

CTA
If you wanna see how it works, swipe up. See you there. (CTA)

How To Apply This Framework:
Let the setting do the selling. Open the clip while in motion. Walk and talk with
something that establishes you as credible related to the thing you talk about. In this one,
I have a fancy car and house behind me. Which—in relation to helping businesses grow—
made sense. (Personally - I only did this for a brief stint in my career and I realized I didn’t
want that kind of brand - so I stopped. But is is effective).
Start with an if-then pain statement. Ex: “Agency owners, if your LTV hasn’t broken
$10k you’ll never hit a $1 million run rate.” The specificity pulls in the right prospects.
Introduce your solution in one sentence. Ex: “I can show you how to do it with a
reverse-royalty model.” Name the solution without explaining it. (We’ll let the lead magnet
do that).

=== Page 63 ===
Show proof that someone worse than them got results better than them. Ex: “We’ve
helped kids in their twenties build $6 million-plus agencies.” Age juxtaposition implies that
bigger, older agencies can do even better. This was the line that did the heavy lifting in case
you were curious. I learned this selling weight loss. I used to say our meal plan was “so
easy to use kids and people who couldn’t speak English followed it”—before asking if the
prospect could. With that preframe, how could they say no (ha). It makes the prospect think
“If they could do it, so can I.”

Section III: My Best Skool Ad Frameworks

Inside this section I’ll give you my five best Skool ad frameworks. These generated the
top .1% of ads. I know this because I published over 3,000 over a 10-month sprint. These
five grew the company by many tens of millions in annual recurring revenue. I break them
down in the following order:
1)  Trending Format
2)  Value Anchor
3)  Bribe
4)  Underdog
5)  Challenge With Prize

Let’s start with the first…

=== Page 66 === [BLANK PAGE]

=== Page 67 ===
Ad Framework #1: Trending Format

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
This ad capitalize on current popular video formats. The example I show emerged
when podcast clips were my entire feed. I had the biggest “duh” moment in life when I
realized—these are popular for a reason, I may as well make my own and use it to sell stuff.
To be clear—the lesson to take from this ad isn’t that it was a podcast, it’s that it was a
popular video format at the time. This is something I didn’t understand when I was a “pure
ads guy”. Making organic content has changed the way I see ads—and made me much
better at them.
Organic is always ahead of paid ads because of the volume and speed of testing for
creators. If you want to see where ads will be in six to 12 months, just look at where organic
is today. This is a huge point that will be missed by most.
You can model this ad directly or indirectly. If you want to model the ad directly, you
can take the podcast style ad. This may work for a short period while short podcast clips are
still “in”. Just truthfully explain why you think your thing is awesome by hitting the main
value equation pillar. Then cut to a CTA. Bingo bango.
If you want to model the larger concept, look at organic content to inform your ad
hooks and content. Take the best organic hooks and use them in your own ads. Even better,
if you make organic content, take your highest performing organic content and simply bolt
on a CTA on the end. This ad style can be modeled across any niche selling any product or
service. I use it all the time. It’s one of my most frequently used ad styles.

PART III: MY ADS BLACKBOOK: BEST 20 AD FRAMEWORKS OF ALL TIME

Visual Hook:
•  “Podcast style”
•  Looks like an organic clip

Ad Copy:
Hook
So we launched the Skool Games a little over two weeks ago, and I was surprised at how
much people were making so quickly, (HOOK)

Meat/Offer
like the top 10 people in the games, you know, they’re making 10, 20, 30, 40 plus thousand
dollars a month, and that’s new revenue. Like they started at zero on the first of the month.
(GOOD STUFF - SPEED)

=== Page 69 ===
And that got me really excited because we believe that we gave all this training and made
the platform super easy and simple that we’d be able to get a lot of people over the hump. I
just didn’t understand how many people we were gonna be able to help do it (PERCEIVED
LIKELIHOOD). And so now we have hundreds of people who are making their first dollar
online (PERCEIVED LIKELIHOOD), which is the whole point of all the stuff that I
do now.
I’m even more convicted in promoting the Skool Games, letting people know that I think
it’s the easiest way for them to get started online (EASE). And if you’ve ever been on the
fence or been like, man, I don’t know how to do this, or I’m not an expert or I don’t have an
audience inside the community (BAD STUFF). There’s right now eight different kinds of
models that people are doing all that don’t require you to have an audience or be an expert.
(EASE + PERCEIVED LIKELIHOOD)

CTA
And so if you’ve been on the fence and you haven’t been sure what to do, but you do know
that you want to start making money on the internet, you wanna start your first business
online, um, I think this is the best way to do it.

=== Page 70 ===
PART III: MY ADS BLACKBOOK: BEST 20 AD FRAMEWORKS OF ALL TIME

Stack speed and scaled proof in one line. Ex: Top 10 are already pulling $10k, $20k,
even $40k a month after starting a zero on the list. “Top bloggers plus a 30-day window
make the result feel both huge and fast. Note: this ad was targeted at prosumers. If you
want to capture a different segment you’d say different stuff more aligned with their desires
and expectations.
Hammer perceived likelihood and ease by removing every classic objection using
proof. Ex: I explain that hundreds have made their first dollar online and that eight different
no-audience models exist. This crushed the “I don’t have an audience objection” and the
“but what if I don’t succeed” fear. It also balances the “non-typical” outcomes with the
“everyday” outcomes. Important: I always try to include both big and average outcomes in
my ads. Because people want to know the big thing is possible, but most importantly, want
to understand what’s likely.

=== Page 71 ===
SECTION III: MY BEST SKOOL AD FRAMEWORKS

Ad Framework #2: Value Anchor

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
I discovered this ad framework during the first batch of ads I recorded to kick off the
Skool Games. And this framework became a clear winner for a while. You may have even
seen it. This fueled the first ever Skool Games.

Things to pay attention to. This is an offer-centric ad. It has two “stacks” that anchor
high then “price drop”. First, the hook does this to anchor what someone would be willing
to pay to get their dream business. Most people would pay $1,000—but if you could do it for
free—even better.
The second “stack” and price drop happen once we explain how we help them. Most
people charge $10,000+ for stuff like this, but instead... well do it free.
Then, we add a variable reward in making this “better than free” because not only does
it cost them nothing, they could get something too.
A strong visual and verbal hook + two back to back stacks + strong bonus incentive
create a very compelling ad. This structure could be copied in any niche. It might sound like
this…
How much would you pay for DREAM OUTCOME? $XXX. $XX. $X? —Explain
offer→Anchor value of offer at marketplace rate. —Give it freelor less than anchor→Add in a lastminute
incentive that makes it even better than free. → CTA.

=== Page 72 ===

Would you pay a thousand dollars to get the business of your dream in 30 days?

Meat/Offer
Well, how about a hundred dollars to get the business of your dream in 30 days? Well, how
about free?

=== Page 73 ===
If that sounds at all interesting. We just launched the Skool Games to help you build and
monetize a community on one platform in 30 days. (BENEFIT)
And this training is the type of stuff that people charge a thousand, $5,000 for, $10,000
(ANCHOR) for, and it’s yours. Absolutely free. And to give you one more added incentive,
the top 10 Skools that get built in the 30 days, are, we’re gonna fly out to Vegas to spend a full
day with me to help you scale your business from where it is to wherever you want to go.
(MORE GOOD STUFF)
CTA:
Click the link to join for free, and I’ll see you on the other side. (CTA)

How To Apply This Framework:
Open with a scroll-stopping money/prop visual. Film a three-second keyframe of
cash fanned out against a high-contrast backdrop (red works everywhere). Pro Tip: Overlay
oversized text that repeats your first question so even muted viewers grasp the hook before
they can swipe or scroll away.
Make the outcome valuable before you give it away. Free still has costs, this means
that you still have to make free valuable. So you anchor the value by asking a series of
descending questions that compare the outcome to some value (money) or another valuable
thing—“Would you pay $1,000? $100? What if it were free?”—to set an initial value in the
viewer’s mind and make “free” feel like an unexpected windfall instead of a marketing cliché.
Alternatively: Ask how much it would be worth to make something bad go away? Ex: “How
much would you pay to make your back pain go away?”
Put the dream outcome on a fast timeline. Follow the anchor and price drop with a
one-sentence promise: “Our product/service] helps you achieve [x] in [duration].”
Make your product/lead magnet valuable before giving it away. Call out real
competitor pricing (Ex: “Most courses cost $1k–$10k”) to prove your free offer doesn’t suck.
If it’s true, it’s compelling.
Make it better than free with a variable incentive. Offer an extra incentive (trip,
coaching day, premium tool, etc.) for the top performers/random selection/or everyone.
Point: Turning zero cost into potential gain (at no cost).

Ad Framework #3: Bribe

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
This framework is a monster—fully machined. It came from my first Skool Games shoot:
one brutal day cranking out ~250 ads. Different hooks. Meat. CTAs. Background colors.
Shirts. Pure Mozi volume-and-testing violence. People romanticize random hits, but volume
negates luck. The real winners are built by deliberate work. This ad is no exception. There’s
zero magic here.
It’s a killer offer-driven ad up front driving to a page that did the heavy lifting. To be
clear—some selling always has to happen. But, you can pack it into the ad or shift it to the
page. We found shorter, proof-heavy creatives worked best for us. We just needed enough to
earn the click, then let the page and video sales letter close.
I’ve reused this meat hundreds of times because it converts. Once this winner emerged
from the 250+ day, I probably cut another 200+ variations of this winner alone.
Also note, the hook reappears later in the Blackbook in a totally different niche. I recycle
hooks and formats across industries. You should too. Only amateurs reinvent the wheel.
Pros use proven playbooks and checklists and make up for the rest with volume. As usual.
Big visuals. Big offer. Small words. Short sentences. This is the way.

Ad Framework #4: Underdog

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
This style… also crushed. I repeated it multiple times only changing out the person I
described. It outperformed every time. What’s beautiful about it is is sets low expectations—
which is my preference. I also think it’s more believable. People already know earning an
income is cool. The issue is they don’t believe they’ll be able to do it. This style ad squashes that
objection up front.

CTA

=== Page 81 ===
Stack proof by naming progressively larger results, then pivot back to the smallest.
Mention big achiever #1 and big achiever #2 and their outcomes, then circle back to the
underdog outcome to show the floor, not just the ceiling. This contrast makes your offer
credible to beginners while still engaging top performers.
Give them a good “reason why” this promotion is a big deal. One of my marketing
rules: They’ll only think it’s a big deal if you tell them it is. So tell them! Prospects will believe
that you’d do something big and crazy if you have a big and crazy reason. Ex: I called
it “the biggest games ever” so prospects feel they’re about to miss something big, not a
routine promotion. Putting your money where your mouth is dissolves skepticism and
adds credibility.

Ad Framework #5: Challenge With Prize

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
Six months of Skool Games later and we asked ourselves “what could we do to kick
thing — up a notch?” We paused in silence, then one of us eventually said “we could give
a Cybertruck to the winner”. We both liked it. So, that’s what we did. And—it worked
like gangbusters.
This ad framework was dynamite. So as the campaign. They brought announcment in buckets of
users. The permutations of this hook + visuals combo dominated for the rest of the year.
To state the obvious, you don’t need to give away massive amounts of cash or a Cybertruck
to make your marketing more compelling—but it helps. Ideally, you want something that’s
huge for your audience. The broader the audience though, the more things like money, cars,
and vacations work. But for a gym owner, re-outfitting their old gym with new equipment
would be even more compelling. So—stay creative.

=== Page 84 ===
PART II: MY ADS BLACKBOOK: BEST 20 AD FRAMEWORKS OF ALL TIME

Visual Hook:
•  Immediately shows Cybertruck
•  Stack of cash in hand
•  With pattern interrupt of metal ball being thrown against the truck glass within the

Hook
This is a Cybertruck. This is a hundred grand. And in the next 30 days I’m gonna be giving
away one to one person who’s watching this ad right now. (HOOK)

And the way you win it is by building the largest community on Skool within the next 30
days. (SPEED)
Last month, I think the winner had 40 or $50,000 a month in monthly recurring revenue.
(DREAM OUTCOME + PERCEIVED LIKELIHOOD)
And so this is a hundred thousand dollars prize or more, depending on how much you like
Cybertrucks (DREAM OUTCOME). And we make it pretty easy (EASE). So right now,
one out of two people who start a paid community on Skool make their first dollar online
(PERCEIVED LIKELIHOOD). Oftentimes it’s much more, the average is 1,360 bucks per
month in recurring revenue. (DREAM OUTCOME)

=== Page 85 ===
CTA
And so if that sounds interesting to you, the best part is you

=== Page 51 ===
And for a brick and mortar business, that is the thing that they want. They want bodies in
the door and they know what a body in the door is worth to them, right? (SPECIFIC) And
so what we did was we said, okay, we're gonna ascribe a value to this number. And so the
question is, let's say it's a hundreded dollars per person who walks in the door per person, that's
a person. (EXAMPLE/HYPOTHETICAL PROOF)

Just go with me. It's a hundred dollars per person who walks in the door. How many would
you like? (DREAM OUTCOME) that you can have per customer, but instead, the customer becomes greedy
and wants to get as many as humanly possible. Think about this. When you have your
retainer model, which is a recurring model, imagine going to a customer a day 30 and
saying, Hey, I'd like you to pay us twice as much.

Probably wouldn't go too well, (SPECIFIC PAIN) but what if you said, Hey, it's day
30, you're within your KPIs. So let's just double your ad spend. They're gonna say, sure.
(OPPORTUNITY) But what ends up happening is that you just doubled the amount of
people that are gonna show up at their facility and therefore how much you can charge.
(DREAM OUTCOME)

And so this is just one of the ways that when we switched from a retainer to a performance
model, oops. Made a lot of videos today (THROWAWAY JOKES). Um, then we switched
from retainer, true performance model. We were able to make a whole bunch more, whatever.
It's somewhere.

CTA
But the point is, is that if you wanna see exactly how this model works, go ahead, click and
then apply. (CTA 1)

And I'll show you exactly how we made this transition and how hundreds of other agencies
are doing it right now, and seeing massive amounts of profit, lower churn, higher amounts
per customer, and ultimately making themselves a much stronger and more competitive
business. So if you're gonna do that, go click, uh, apply, and then we'll see you on the other
side. (CTA 2)

Make a big claim with details. "We turned $1,500/month clients into $15,000/month
clients—same niche, same leads." Big increase + same context + curiosity.

Attribute all the pain in their life to their outdated model. Be as specific as possible
with the problems they're likely dealing with and attribute all relevant woes to their outdated
model. If the person relates to the old way, and the problems you describe, they'll be hooked
to hear how you solved them.

Reveal the new way and anchor it to a simple metric. Erase the old graph, draw a line,
or turn the page etc. Then rewrite "$100 per show" (or your new unit). Explain your model/
way/method is superior based on this simplified metric.

Drive it home with a case study or hypothetical. Ex: "On day 30 you don't ask for
double the retainer—you just double ad spend. Clients say yes because ROI is already
proven." The math makes the promise believable and serves as a proxy for proof.

Reinforce authority with a single proof line. Ex: "We've generated $98.5 million in
one niche using this switch." One number is enough. Just make it compelling.

Make a risk-reversed offer if possible. Ex: "If you don't make money, I don't get paid."

Finish with a CTA that previews the process. Ex: "Click 'Apply,' my EA will confirm
you qualify, then we'll map your numbers on a 15-minute call." This keeps you elevated
and maintains the frame that this is by application only and that you actually only want
qualified leads.

Close with your hook. You can start with something like this: "I'm looking for five
[AVATAR] doing roughly [CURRENT METRIC] who want [10x OUTCOME] by
swapping their [OLD MODEL] for a [NEW MECHANISM]. We've already produced
[SINGLE PROOF STAT], and if you don't, I don't get paid [RISK REVERSAL].
Click to apply—my team will verify fit and show the math. [QUALIFIED CTA]"

SECTION I: MY BEST GYM LAUNCH AD FRAMEWORKS

Ad Framework #3: Emotional Avatar Testimonial

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
This ad framework absolutely CRUSHES. It birthed one of my best ads of all time
(broken down below). We easily ran 100+ variations of this one piece of creative alone. And
they all performed.

This ad features Cale and Maggie who were some of my first Gym Launch customers.
Their lives had obviously changed since using the systems at Gym Launch. They asked if
they could do anything for me in return. I asked them to film a testimonial and gave them
six points to hit: 1) what was life like before personally and 2) professionally. 3) What
skepticism did you have and 4) why did you choose to take action anyways. 5) What was life
after like personally and 6) professionally.

And they knocked it out of the park. I don't think we've had a testimonial outperform
this one in the company's history. Let's break it down so you can use it.

The 4 WARNING SIGNS
Your Agency Will NEVER Pass $1M/Yr

- Agency owners.

Visual Hooks:
• Man in front of whiteboard = educational = value
• Think of this as "aductional"
• An educational setting works better with more complex products

Ad Copy:
Hook
Agency owners (CALL OUT), I wanna show you the four warning signs your agency will
never pass a million dollars per year. (HOOK)

Meat/Offer
And the reason I know this is ’cause we've taken 68 companies over the last four years, over a
million dollars, and on our own company, we've done over a hundred million dollars in sales
in a single niche. (PROOF)

And these patterns repeat themselves over and over and over again. The first is if your lifetime
value per customer is less than $10,000, it'll be very difficult for you to pass a million dollar
per year run rate in your agency (SPECIFIC PAIN/PROBLEM). The second is if your
average revenue per client is less than $2,500 per month. (SPECIFIC PAIN/PROBLEM)

And what I mean by that is if, if you take all of your clients and you take all your revenue
and you divide it out, if your average revenue per client is less than $2,500 per month, it's
very difficult to have enough profit to continue to scale. The third is if your gross margin is
less than 80%. (SPECIFIC PAIN/PROBLEM) Alright, so if you charge a thousand dollars
per month, uh, to a client and your profit is $500 a month between your creative person, the
account manager, traffic person, et cetera, then your margins are gonna be below 80% and
it's gonna be difficult for you to scale.

And then finally, if your payback period is over 30 days, meaning it takes you more than
30 days with a customer to recover the cost that it costs you to acquire them. (SPECIFIC
PAIN/PROBLEM) So that would be the commission, the ad spend, and any other cost
associated with getting a customer. If it takes you more than 30 days to make that amount
of profit off the customer, you'll be very cash constrained. (SPECIFIC PAIN/PROBLEM).

You won't have enough cash flow to continue to reinvest in ads and continue to market
profitably. (SPECIFIC PAIN). Alright? Now, you may be suffering from one or even all four
of these things, but the good news is there is a model that reverses it and it's not a retainer
model. It's called the reverse royalty model. (OPPORTUNITY)

And I have a seven minute video that breaks down how it, it capitalizes on all four of these
things. Flips ’em to your favor unless you get way more customers. And at the end of the day,
take home a lot more than that. (LEAD MAGNET/VSL)

CTA
Alright, so if you're interested in that, click uh, opt in, watch the video (CTA 1). And if it
sounds interesting to you, you can apply and schedule a 15-minute call with my team and
we'll see if this model works in your niche. (CTA 2)

How To Apply This Framework
Begin by standing in front of a whiteboard and addressing your exact avatar in the
first sentence. Ex: "Agency owners, let me show you the four warning signs you'll never
cross $1 million a year." The setting projects authority, and the hyper-specific call-out filters
for qualified prospects.

Establish authority. Ex: "We've taken 68 companies past $1 million and generated
$100 million ourselves." A single, giant credential convinces the audience to keep listening.

Rapid-fire through prospect-specific pains. Ex: LTV under $10k, ARPC under $2.5k,
gross margin below 80%, payback over 30 days. Each number makes owners think, "This
is me."

Introduce your new solution. Ex: "the reverse-royalty model." Name it something
non-obvious. Explain what it is in one sentence and how it inverts all their problems. I had
to come up with "reverse royalty" because "Pay Per Show" was too obvious and killed the
curiosity.

CTA to your lead magnet or Video Sales Letter. If you need the prospect to consume
more information to buy, tell them how. Ex: "Click to opt in, watch a seven-minute demo,
then book a 15-minute qualification call."

Rapid-fire through prospect-specific pains. Ex: LTV under $10k, ARPC under $2.5k,
gross margin below 80%, payback over 30 days. Each number makes owners think, "This
is me."
Introduce your new solution. Ex: "the reverse-royalty model." Name it something
non-obvious. Explain what it is in one sentence and how it inverts all their problems. I had
to come up with "reverse royalty" because "Pay Per Show" was too obvious and killed the
curiosity.
CTA to your lead magnet or Video Sales Letter. If you need the prospect to consume
more information to buy, tell them how. Ex: "Click to opt in, watch a seven-minute demo,
then book a 15-minute qualification call."

SECTION II: MY BEST GYM LAUNCH AD FRAMEWORKS

Ad Framework #4: The "North Star"

Why This Ad Framework Rocks

In this framework, I create a "north star" metric. Then I predict their pain point based
on this metric (it can be anything as long as it's predictive). For example, if you know a
man's neck and wrist thickness you can predict their body fat. You need to pick a metric that
does the same for your prospect.
Then, list a series of pain points that resonate with them. Attribute all this pain to their
old way of doing things which causes the north star metric to lag. It explains how all these
dream outcomes aren't achievable for them right now. It lists what they want and explains
why it's out of reach. Then I post that my model can help them and invite them to find out
more.
I want to zero in on something that's always seemed to differentiate my copy from that
of other people—specificity. Instead of explaining, let me show you...
For example, I could tell you probably a million very specific problems for gyms.
• Members saying the music is too loud while five minutes earlier a member
complained it was too quiet.
• A member complaining that we needed more variety of music right after another
asked me to play the same playlist as last week because they liked it.
• One member requesting clean music with no curse words while another asked
for the real music since the gym is for adults.
• My mic battery dying and having to shout over the music until my voice gave
out.
• Realizing that my members cared more about my playlists than they did about
my workouts.
• Getting a cease and desist for playing my personal playlist over the speakers
because I hadn't licensed the music in a commercial setting.
• iPhones ringing or alarms going off because a trainer plugged their phone in to
play music.
• Commercials in the middle of a song while my gym is going on because a trainer
put their phone on and hadn't paid for premium.

=== Page 58 ===
And all these examples are just about the music in a gym that you might not have
thought about—but if you were a gym owner, you would've. Be specific.

AGENCY OWNERS
Learn Why You Haven't Passed $1M/Yr

- Agencies, if you are struggling

Visual Hook:
• Another ADucational video
• If something works, keep doing it--that might be a better meta-lesson than any of
the ad hooks.

Ad Copy:
Hook
Agencies. (CALLOUT) If you are struggling to break through a plateau and you're struggling
to grow your agency, it's probably not because you don't know how to get customers. It's
cause you probably don't make enough per customer. (HOOK)

Meat/Offer
And now after taking 68 different businesses over a million dollar run rate and taking our
own business over a hundred million dollars in revenue (PROOF), I can tell you that these
patterns repeat themselves over and over and over again. The first is if your lifetime
value per customer is less than $10,000, it'll be very difficult for you to pass a million dollar
per year run rate in your agency (SPECIFIC PAIN/PROBLEM). The second is if your
average revenue per client is less than $2,500 per month. (SPECIFIC PAIN/PROBLEM)
And what I mean by that is if, if you take all of your clients and you take all your revenue
and you divide it out, if your average revenue per client is less than $2,500 per month, it's
very difficult to have enough profit to continue to scale. The third is if your gross margin is
less than 80%. (SPECIFIC PAIN/PROBLEM) Alright, so if you charge a thousand dollars
per month, uh, to a client and your profit is $500 a month between your creative person, the
account manager, traffic person, et cetera, then your margins are gonna be below 80% and
it's gonna be difficult for you to scale.
And then finally, if your payback period is over 30 days, meaning it takes you more than
30 days with a customer to recover the cost that it costs you to acquire them. (SPECIFIC
PAIN/PROBLEM) So that would be the commission, the ad spend, and any other cost
associated with getting a customer. If it takes you more than 30 days to make that amount
of profit off the customer, you'll be very cash constrained. (SPECIFIC PAIN/PROBLEM).
You won't have enough cash flow to continue to reinvest in ads and continue to market
profitably. (SPECIFIC PAIN). Alright? Now, you may be suffering from one or even all four
of these things, but the good news is there is a model that reverses it and it's not a retainer
model. It's called the reverse royalty model. (OPPORTUNITY)
And I have a seven minute video that breaks down how it, it capitalizes on all four of these
things. Flips 'em to your favor unless you get way more customers. And at the end of the day,
take home a lot more than that. (LEAD MAGNET/VSL)

CTA
Alright, so if you're interested in that, click uh, opt in, watch the video (CTA 1). And if it
sounds interesting to you, you can apply and schedule a 15-minute call with my team and
we'll see if this model works in your niche. (CTA 2)

=== Page 59 ===
How To Apply This Framework

Explain why you're only taking limited clients. It can be "to get great case studies" or
"to prove my stuff works" or "because we're new to the area" or "because I'm starting out and
will do everything I can to win" etc. No matter what you choose, make it believable. I prefer
the truth (ha).
Why your thing is better than what's out there. The difference should elevate your
product/service. You'll underline this with proof.
Split risk with the customer. Promise to win with them and have some element of
performance compensation; this decreases risk, shows intent to deliver, and attracts
more people.
Send them to your assistant. Ex: "Click the link, apply, and my EA will call to confirm
you fit the requirements." Mentioning my executive assistant further reinforced my authority
and the authenticity of the ad.

Ad Framework #4: You're Being Lied To

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
This ad framework drove a truckload of registrations and book buyers. It's another spin
on a classic: old way vs. new way. Problem vs. solution. Us vs. them. The classics are classics
for a reason—they work.
The ad likely also worked well because walking around corners and high movement,
especially towards the camera works exceptionally well. This confrontational style paired
well with the hook which was also confrontational.
People for whatever reason have a harder time walking and talking. So, it makes it
somewhat rarer when people do it well. Give it a shot. Ads where I move almost always
outperform. And if you're wondering why I don't do that all the time, I'm wondering the
same thing myself.

Ad Framework #5: No BS Selfie

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
This ad framework is very short. First, you can bang a ton of these out with little
effort. Next, you can do them on your own in a bunch of different settings. Beyond that,
constraining your time forces you to limit your words to the only things that matter. These
ads rely on having additional information in the funnel and conversion process. Think of
this as an ad for your lead magnet more than an ad to sell. It sells the next step. Nothing
more. These can work well at the top of the funnel.

Beyond that, I think the camera movement, the house in the background, nice car, and
casual selfie-style did a lot of the heavy lifting... and one of the lines of copy. I'll let you guess
which.

And we've had $6 million-plus agencies for kids in their twenties. (PROOF)

CTA
If you wanna see how it works, swipe up. See you there. (CTA)

How To Apply This Framework

Let the setting do the selling. Open the clip while in motion. Walk and talk with
something that establishes you as credible related to the thing you talk about. In this one,
I have a fancy car and house behind me. Which—in relation to helping businesses grow—
made sense. (Personally-I only did this for a brief stint in my career and I realized I didn't
want that kind of brand - so I stopped. But it is effective).

Start with an if-then pain statement. Ex: "Agency owners, if your LTV hasn't broken
$10k you'll never hit a $1 million run rate." The specificity pulls in the right prospects.

Introduce your solution in one sentence. Ex: "I can show you how to do it with a
reverse-royalty model." Name the solution without explaining it. (We'll let the lead magnet
do that).

=== Page 63 ===
Ad Framework #5: No BS Selfie (Continued)

Show proof that someone worse than them got results better than them. Ex: "We've
helped kids in their twenties build $6 million-plus agencies." Age juxtaposition implies that
bigger, older agencies can do even better. This was the line that did the heavy lifting in case
you were curious. I learned this selling weight loss. I used to say our meal plan was "so
easy to use kids and people who couldn't speak English followed it"—before asking if the
prospect could. With that preframe, how could they say no (ha). It makes the prospect think
"If they could do it, so can I."

Inside this section I’ll give you my five best Skool ad frameworks. These generated the
top .1% of ads. I know this because I published over 3,000 over a 10-month sprint. These
five grew the company by many tens of millions in annual recurring revenue. I break them
down in the following order:

1) Trending Format
2) Value Anchor
3) Bribe
4) Underdog
5) Challenge With Prize

Let’s start with the first…

=== Page 66 ===
SECTION III: MY BEST SKOOL AD FRAMEWORKS
Ad Framework #1: Trending Format

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
This ad framework cruuushes.
Trend ads capitalize on current popular video formats. The example I show emerged
when podcast clips were my entire feed. I had the biggest “duh” moment in life when I
realized—these are popular for a reason, I may as well make my own and use it to sell stuff.
To be clear—the lesson to take from this ad isn’t that it was a podcast, it’s that it was a
popular video format at the time. This is something I didn’t understand when I was a “pure
ads guy”. Making organic content has changed the way I see ads—and made me much
better at them.
Organic is always ahead of paid ads because of the volume and speed of testing for
creators. If you want to see where ads will be in six to 12 months, just look at where organic
is today. This is a huge point that will be missed by most.
You can model this ad directly or indirectly. If you want to model the ad directly, you
can take the podcast style ad. This may work for a short period while short podcast clips are
still “in”. Just truthfully explain why you think your thing is awesome by hitting the main
value equation pitch run to a CTA. Bingo bango.
If you want to model the larger concept, look at organic content to inform your ad
hooks and content. Take the best organic hooks and use them in your own ads. Even better,
if you make organic content, take your highest performing organic content and simply bolt
on a CTA on the end. This ad style can be modeled across any niche selling any product or
service. I use it all the time. It’s one of my most frequently used ad styles.

PART III: WHAT TO DO NEXT ‐CHECKLISTS
You’ve now seen the whole machine—how I find winners, how I multiply them, and the
exact steps to do it. Three ideas power the engine.
First, volume negates luck. The process is simple: make lots of ads, spot the few that
perform, pour 80% of your effort into remixing and remaking those, then spend the other
20% hunting for the next winner. One winner is enough to start the flywheel. Permutations
keep it spinning.
Second, winners are rare, so squeeze every drop of blood from them. 80% of sales come
from 20% of ads. When an ad finally clicks, hammer it until it dies—then rerun it with
Kaleidoscope variations. Run new colors, headlines, props, speeds, fonts, swap settings,
talent, and examples. All those small twists cost a fraction of inventing a new winner,
and will give you consistent solid returns. Consistent winners take the volatility out of
advertising.
Third, winning ad frameworks work for any business. The 20 ads you just studied sell
gym services, software, agencies, and a book, yet every hook, proof stack, and CTA can sell
whatever you’ve got. Steal the open-loop selfie, the white-board “four reasons,” the prize
challenge, or the low-number underdog. Swap the details, record, ship, test, repeat. Make
them yours.

make it easy for you to find what you’re looking for.
Here are two checklists on the following pages for the next time you make ads. One for

Ad Kaleidoscope Checklist
Post‐production: Apply to an existing winning ad (in order of difficulty)
• New Speed: Ex: Play the entire spot at 1.1x. Just make sure your voice doesn’t sound
weird.
• New Filters: Ex: Add a short contrast black-and-white filter, or sepia, or social media
style filter, so video looks different than the original.
• New Background/Border: Ex: Swap a white backdrop for a neon-green gradient
border.
• New Fonts/Captions: Ex: Replace the default subtitle font with bold, comic-style
caps for the first three words (or in its entirety).
• New Headline: Ex: Change “Double Your Leads Fast” to “Steal Our 30-Day Leads
Blueprint”. Keep the text arrow.
• New Medium: Ex: Take your hook from one ad, "Would you build your dream
business for $1000? $100? Well how about free?" and turn it into an image.
• New Format: Ex: Re-edit the vertical selfie ad into a square 1:1 version for different
ad placement. Native placements improve performance big time.
• New Meat: Ex: Keep the winning hook, but splice in a different case-study clip for
the body copy.
• New Effects: Ex: Drop a “BOOM” motion-graphic sticker over the revenue figure
as it appears. Or show some visual proof after you say a number-driven hook.
Pre‐production: Record a fresh version of the same winner
• New Clone: Ex: same gestures, script, background but different clothing, lighting,
etc.—so micro‐differences feel fresh to viewers.
• New Props: Ex: Swap the stack of cash for a silver platter holding signup sheets.
• New Examples: Ex: “$4497/mo Kyle” to “$6398/mo Sarah”
• New Setting: Ex: Film the ad on a sidewalk instead of inside the office.

• New Talent: Ex: Have someone else deliver the script instead of you to attract an
avatar that looks like them. Or even if the person doing the second take is the same
demographic as you, at the very least, it’ll look different.
• New Combination Ex: Shoot the ad on a rooftop (new setting) with a bright red
megaphone (new prop) and overlay comic-book captions (post-production font
change).

SECTION II: MY BEST ALAN AD FRAMEWORKS

Ad Framework #2: Value Anchor

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
I discovered this ad framework during the first batch of ads I recorded to kick off the
Skool Games. And this framework became a clear winner for a while. You may have even
seen it. This fueled the first ever Skool Games.

Things to pay attention to. This is an offer-centric ad. It has two "stacks" that anchor
high then "price drop". First, the hook does this to anchor what someone would be willing
to pay to get their dream business. Most people would pay $1,000- but if you could do it for
free-even better.

The second "stack" and price drop happen once we explain how we help them. Most
people charge $10,000+ for stuff like this, but instead. . . we'll do it free.

Then, we add a variable reward in making this "better than free" because not only does
it cost them nothing, they could get something too.

A strong visual and verbal hook + two back to back stacks + strong bonus incentive
create a very compelling ad. This structure could be copied in any niche. It might sound like
this...

How much would you pay for DREAM OUTCOME? $XXX, $XX, $X? -Explain
offer-Anchor value of offer at marketplace rate. -Give it free/for less than anchor- Add in a last-
minute incentive that makes it even better than free. - CTA.

CTA:
Click the link to join for free, and I'll see you on the other side. (CTA)

How To Apply This Framework.
Open with a scroll-stopping money/prop visual. Film a three-second keyframe of
cash fanned out against a high-contrast backdrop (red works everywhere). Pro Tip: Overlay
oversized text that repeats your first question so even muted viewers grasp the hook before
they can swipe or scroll away.

Make the outcome valuable before you give it away. Free still has costs, this means
you still have to make free valuable. So you anchor the value by asking a series of
descending questions that compare the outcome to some value (money) or another valuable
thing—"Would you pay $1,000? $100? What if it were free?"—to set an initial value in the
viewer’s mind and make "free" feel like an unexpected windfall instead of a marketing cliché.
Alternatively: Ask how much it would be worth to make something bad go away. Ex: "How
much would you pay to make your back pain go away?"

Put the dream outcome on a fast timeline. Follow the anchor and price drop with a
one-sentence promise: "Our [product/service] helps you achieve [x] in [duration]."

Make your product/lead magnet valuable before giving it away. Call out real
competitor pricing (Ex: "Most courses cost $1k-$10k") to prove your free offer doesn't suck.
If it's true, it’s compelling.

Make it better than free with a variable incentive. Offer an extra incentive (trip,
coaching day, premium tool, etc.) for the top performers/random selection/or everyone.
Point: Turning zero cost into potential gain (at no cost).

SECTION III: MY BEST SKOOL AD FRAMEWORKS

Ad Framework #3: Bribe

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
This framework is a monster—fully machined. It came from my first Skool Games shoot:
one brutal day cranking out ~250 ads. Different hooks. Meat. CTAs. Background colors.
Shirts. Pure Mozi volume-and-testing violence. People romanticize random hits, but volume
negates luck. The real winners are built by deliberate work. This ad is no exception. There's
zero magic here.

It's a killer offer-driven ad up front driving to a page that did the heavy lifting. To be
clear—some selling always has to happen. But, you can pack it into the ad or shift it to the
page. We found shorter, proof-heavy creatives worked best for us. We just needed enough to
earn the click, then let the page and video sales letter close.

I've reused this meat hundreds of times because it converts. Once this winner emerged
from the 250+ day, I probably cut another 200+ variations of this winner alone.

Also note. the hook reappears later in the Blackbook in a totally different niche. I recycle
hooks and formats across industries. You should too. Only amateurs reinvent the wheel.
Pros use proven playbooks and checklists and make up for the rest with volume. As usual.
Big visuals. Big offer. Small words. Short sentences. This is the way.

Visual Hookz

•	Three-second keyframe in creates immediate motion
•	Big background color
•	Text fills the screen repeating the hook

Ad Copy:
Hook
Real quick, can I get your email address? Because I wanna send you a thousand dollars of free
stuff straight to your inbox.

Meat
And the way I'm gonna do that is through the Skool Games. I will help you build a community
and monetize that community through Skool (DREAM OUTCOME). And this training is
the type of stuff that people charge a thousand, $5,000 for, $10,000 for. (ANCHOR)

And it's yours absolutely free. And the reason I'm doing all this is because I just became the
co-owner of Skool. (REASON WHY)

CTA
And to commemorate that, I wanted to make the most insane offer ever. If interested, click
the link and I'll see you on the other side.

How To Apply This Framework
Ask them for contact information with a pattern-interrupt question. Open with
a hidden prop behind your back, and lead with "Real quick—can I get your [info]?" The
swing-into-frame reveal plus direct ask buys you time and immediately signals that handing
over contact info triggers something valuable.

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION

=== Page 76 ===
Tell them what they'll get in exchange.  Promise valuable free stuff.  Ex:  "$1,000 of free
stuff straight to your inbox."  Stating cash value (if realistic) turns a vague lead magnet into
a tangible benefit.

Explain why it's valuable by anchoring against real market pricing.  Point out that
comparable products/services sell for more and escalate the numbers. (Ex: $1k, $5k, $10k+).
Now "free" feels more like generosity than gimmick.

Clarify what it will help them do--the dream outcome.  In one line, tie the gift to a
result that matters. "Build and monetize your own community in 30 days."  Outcome focus
prevents the offer from sounding random.

Add an additional incentive if desired.  And give a reason why.  Ex:  "It's my birthday,
so I’m giving an insane bonus to the first 100 clients."  A motive behind a bonus makes the
bonus feel more authentic, and by extension increases urgency.

Make your CTA the same as your hooks.  Remind them to get the free thing by taking
action. This mirrors the hook and increases congruency in the ad. Said differently, if they
stayed to watch because of the hook, they’ll also take the next step because of it too. Ex: "If
[HOOK], then [CTA]," mirroring the initial info ask to take the next step.

Ad Framework #4: Underdog

Why This Ad Framework Rocks

This style... also crushed. I repeated it multiple times only changing out the person I
described. It outperformed every time. What’s beautiful about it is is sets low expectations—
which is my preference, I also think it’s more believable. People already know earning an
income is cool. The issue is they don’t believe they’ll be able to do it. This style ad squashes that
objection up front.

So don’t be afraid to talk about your lower tier outcomes—beat people to the punch.
They’re already doubtful. They already wonder, “yea but what about the average person,
what about the below-average person” —so tell them. Then, contrast it by saying you don’t
want to talk about all these amazing outcomes. This gains you trust, while also talking about
the higher range of outcomes to attract those higher achievers as well.

End result: you attract all potential buyers, elegantly, without setting crazy high
expectations. You just state the facts and tell the truth.

Ad Framework #5: Challenge With Prize

Why This Ad Framework Rocks

Six months of Skool Games later and we asked ourselves “what could we do to kick
things up a notch?” We paused in silence, then one of us eventually said “we could give
a Cybertruck to the winner”. We both liked it. So, that’s what we did. And—it worked
like gangbusters.

This ad framework was dynamite. So as the campaign. They brought swarms in buckets of
users. The permutations of this hook + visuals combo dominated for the rest of the year.
To state the obvious, you don’t need to give away massive amounts of cash or a Cybertruck
to make your marketing more compelling—but it helps. Ideally, you want something that’s
huge for your audience. The broader the audience though, the more things like money, cars,
and vacations work. But for a gym owner, re-outfitting their old gym with new equipment
would be even more compelling. So—stay creative.

Hook
This is a Cybertruck. This is a hundred grand. And in the next 30 days I’m gonna be giving
away one to one person who’s watching this ad right now. (HOOK)

Meat/Offer
And the way you win it is by building the largest community on Skool within the next 30
days. (SPEED)
Last month, I think the winner had 40 or $50,000 a month in monthly recurring revenue.
(DREAM OUTCOME + PERCEIVED LIKELIHOOD)

And so this is a hundred thousand dollars prize or more, depending on how much you like
Cybertrucks (DREAM OUTCOME). And we make it pretty easy (EASE). So right now,
one out of two people who start a paid community on Skool make their first dollar online
(PERCEIVED LIKELIHOOD). Oftentimes it’s much more, the average is 1,360 bucks per
month in recurring revenue. (DREAM OUTCOME)

Which is kinda sweet. And the reason we have such a high success rate (PERCEIVED
LIKELIHOOD) is because we give you the tools, as in I walk you through step by step
exactly what you have to do (EASE). I also answer questions every single week. Hop on. So if
you wanna hop on there live, I think we have about 200, 300 people hop on the call (EASE).

So it’s, it’s not huge and we’re pretty good at doing it and we’ve now done it with thousands
and thousands of people. (PERCEIVED LIKELIHOOD)

Stack proof by naming progressively larger results, then pivot back to the smallest.
Mention big achiever #1 and big achiever #2 and their outcomes, then circle back to the
underdog outcome to show the floor, not just the ceiling. This contrast makes your offer
credible to beginners while still engaging top performers.

Give them a good “reason why” this promotion is a big deal. One of my marketing
rules: They’ll only think it’s a big deal if you tell them it is. So tell them! Prospects will believe
that you’d do something big and crazy if you have a big and crazy reason. Ex: I called
it "the biggest games ever” so prospects felt they’re about to miss something big, not a
routine promotion. Putting your money where your mouth is dissolves skepticism and
adds credibility.

Ad Framework #5: Challenge With Prize

Why This Ad Framework Rocks

Six months of Skool Games later and we asked ourselves "what could we do to kick
things up a notch?" We paused in silence, then one of us eventually said "we could give
a Cybertruck to the winner". We both liked it. So, that's what we did. And--it worked
like gangbusters.

This ad framework was dynamite. So as the campaign. They brought swarms in buckets of
users. The permutations of this hook + visuals combo dominated for the rest of the year.
To state the obvious, you don't need to give away massive amounts of cash or a Cybertruck
to make your marketing more compelling--but it helps. Ideally, you want something that's
huge for your audience. The broader the audience though, the more things like money, cars,
and vacations work. But for a gym owner, re-outfitting their old gym with new equipment
would be even more compelling. So--stay creative.

Visual Hooks:

Ad Copy:
Hook
This is a Cybertruck. This is a hundred grand. And in the next 30 days I'm gonna be giving
away one to one person who's watching this ad right now. (HOOK)

Meat/Offer
And the way you win it is by building the largest community on Skool within the next 30
days. (SPEED)
Last month, I think the winner had 40 or $50,000 a month in monthly recurring revenue.
(DREAM OUTCOME + PERCEIVED LIKELIHOOD)

And so this is a hundred thousand dollars prize or more, depending on how much you like
Cybertrucks (DREAM OUTCOME). And we make it pretty easy (EASE). So right now,
one out of two people who start a paid community on Skool make their first dollar online
(PERCEIVED LIKELIHOOD). Oftentimes it's much more, the average is 1,360 bucks per
month in recurring revenue. (DREAM OUTCOME)

Which is kinda sweet. And the reason we have such a high success rate (PERCEIVED
LIKELIHOOD) is because we give you the tools, as in I walk you through step by step
exactly what you have to do (EASE). I also answer questions every single week. Hop on. So if
you wanna hop on there live, I think we have about 200, 300 people hop on the call (EASE).

=== Page 85 ===
So it's, it's not huge and we're pretty good at doing it and we've now done it with thousands
and thousands of people. (PERCEIVED LIKELIHOOD)

CTA
And so if that sounds cool to you, you can opt in and download, and there's a seven-minute
video that I explain the model in more details and more numbers than I can in this short ad.
Um, and if that sounds interesting, you can click and apply for a 15-minute call and we'll
see if this model would work in your niche.

Hope you found this video valuable, and uh, hope to see you soon.

=== Page 86 ===
How To Apply This Framework

Give away something insane.  Find the stuff your audience likes. Find the most valuable
version you can afford to give away. Then give it away to one or some of them. Ex: a year of
your premium service, a $5,000 store credit, a designer toolkit, even a weekend retreat with
you.  Display it on-camera to prove that you have the thing to give away.

Put it on a time constraint.  Tie the giveaway to a clear, short window—"in the next
30 days," "before quarter-end," "this month only". A deadline gets more people to do it if
it's believable.

Prove somebody else has gotten the thing you give away. Reference a recent contest
winner who won the thing.  Real-world peers prove the prize is winnable and the process
is legitimate.

Tell them exactly how to get it.  Make succeeding their ticket of entry. The simpler to
track (for them and you) the better. Use a single metric that matches your business goal:
most referrals, highest product review count, biggest single purchase, best before-and-after
photo. Note: One clear path beats a complicated points system.

Show how you'll help them win.  Ex: Promise tools, checklists, weekly tips, or live
Q&A so participants know you'll guide them, not abandon them. If this takes tools or
skills, provide them the best you can. Hand-holding overcomes the "I'll get stuck" objection
before it forms.

Make something valuable too.  Remind them the worst-case scenario is walking away
with all the free stuff (Ex: new skills, discounts, or small bonuses) even if they miss the grand
prize. This makes both outcomes a win, and the only bad outcome not doing it. Make sure
they understand the free thing they get has value on its own outside of the grand prize.

Show proof your free thing works.  Cite user counts, testimonial snippets, or quick
screenshots of past wins. Pair visuals with each component to make them dramatically more
compelling—they make a big difference.

Show them what happens the moment they take the next step.  Overlay a fast screen
recording or screenshare mock-up of the signup flow so prospects see exactly where the click
leads. Reducing uncertainty about the next step removes the final barrier to conversion.

Section IV: My Best $100M Leads
Book Launch Ad Frameworks

These ad frameworks brought in over 500,000+ people to register for the event in less
than a month. That’s more than the city of Baltimore, where I’m from. In other words, these
work.

I break the ad frameworks down in the following order:

   1) Flying Prop
   2) Bribe
   3) Rumors Are True
   4) You’re Being Lied To
   5) Data Stack

Let’s dive in.

=== Page 88 ===
[BLANK PAGE]

=== Page 89 ===
Ad Framework #1: Flying Prop

Why This Ad Framework Rocks

We were in my old kitchen filming ads for the launch and the team had the idea to
throw a banana at me. At first, they did it as a joke. But then, I took it seriously. And I’m
glad we did because it became one of the top ad frameworks for the launch.

Stuff that moves generally beats stuff that doesn’t. And real stuff that moves often beats
computer stuff that moves. So, these basically always work. I should probably use them
more.

That being said, it’s clear why they did so well. The entire ad is curiosity-driven. The entire
ad is a daisy chain of open loops with only one action to close them—taking the next step.

Daisy-chained open loops: The banana→The money spent on the event→ My birthday→
Giving a secret away.

Everything has the objective to get people to want to come to see what’s going to happen.
This accomplishes both campaign objectives of getting someone to register and show. So—
accomplishes the mission.

So if you wanna use these types of ads effectively, capitalize on curiosity.

=== Page 90 ===
Visual Hook:

- A flying banana
- Movement + Prop

Ad Copy:

Hook
You might be wondering why I just mushed the shit outta this banana in my hand.

Meat/Offer
And it’s because the launch of my second book, $100M Leads, is both nutritious, natural,
and uh, will make you lots of money unlike bananas (HUMOR). But the event itself, where
I’ll be launching it on Saturday, August 19th, will be bananas.

=== Page 91 ===
I’ve spent over a million dollars on the event itself (APPROXIMATION OF VALUE), and
I’m going to be giving away a secret thing that I’ve been working on for over four years to
everyone who’s there with me live (CURIOSITY). And I would love to tell you what it is. If
kills me inside that I cannot tell you. But I want the surprise itself to be worth it, and I think
it will be. (CURIOSITY)

This is a date that you’re not gonna wanna miss. It’s a day after my birthday and it’s my way
of giving back to you guys for being so awesome. (REASON WHY)

CTA
Click the link to register. I’ll see you guys there.

How To Apply This Framework:
Catch a flying prop.  Start the video by having the spokesperson catch something
mid-air while looking at the camera.

Make a quick joke and tie the prop to your offer.  Drop a one-liner that links the prop
to your product or service.

Pile on tangible reasons to attend.  Mention time invested, money spent, relationship
capital used, etc., so viewers see how much you invested to make this great. Tie that
investment to what they’re gonna get. This approximates their value. In short, make it a big
deal to you, so it's a big deal to them. Stakes are a big part of that.

Hint at a big secret and leave the loop open.  Tease an unrevealed bonus available only
to people who take the next step. Withholding details keeps tension high until they take
action. After they take action, you can open more loops to move them through the process.

Props.  I’d suggest keeping a shed or a storage closet full of these things. You’d be surprised
how often you use them once you start making ads and content regularly. I wish I had done
this sooner. Anytime something catches your attention—if you can buy it, do so—because
it’ll probably catch someone else’s. And when it does, it’ll make you more money than it
costs (by a lot).

[BLANK PAGE]

=== Page 93 ===
Ad Framework #2: Bribe

Why This Ad Framework Rocks

This ad framework also crushed. Beyond it crushing though, I included this to show you
something important. This hook is the same hook I used for a Skool ad. But wait—one is
for an event that sells a book, but the other was to advertise a software platform for building
a community?? Aren’t those two completely different products and businesses??

Yes. And that’s the point.

These ad structures work agnostic of industry. So yes, please model them. Or - don’t. But
I certainly will (and will continue to as long as they work).

Beyond that, you’ll notice yet another common theme—curiosity and open loops. Just
tons of curiosity and stakes to drive the click. Then, you let the page do its job and convert
the traffic.

=== Page 94 ===
Visual Hook:
- Me pointing directly at the viewer asking permission to get their attention

Ad Copy:
Hook
Real quick question, what’s your email address? The reason I ask is because what I wanna do
is send you a gazillion dollars of free stuff...

Meat/Offer
And what that really is, is the biggest entrepreneur event of the season (STAKES). I’m gonna
be releasing my $100M Leads book, which is two years in the making (STAKES) live for
everyone there with a secret project (STAKES) I’ve been working on for four years that I
haven’t said once publicly. I’ve been saving it. I can’t tell you what it is... (STAKES)

CTA
What I can tell you is it’s more than a gift card and less than a Tesla and every single person
who shows up is gonna get one (CURIOSITY), it’s gonna be sick, can’t wait to see you there,
go register. See you there. (CTA)

How To Apply This Framework

Tell them what you want. Open with the pattern-interrupt question, “Real quick—
what’s your [info]?” so viewers instantly know they’re trading consent info for something.

Tell them what they’ll get in exchange. Promise to send something valuable. Ex: “a
gazillion dollars of free stuff,” positioning the giveaway as outrageously valuable for anyone
in your niche.

Explain why it’s valuable. Explain all costs you incurred to create the product, service,
etc. (17 prototypes, my entire life savings, cost me my marriage, this obsession consumed my
past six years, etc.). If you can’t tell someone exactly what something is (to keep curiosity),
then you talk more about your investment as a proxy for their potential benefit. If you can
talk about other parts directly, then do that.

=== Page 95 ===
Emphasize that the thing you promote is a big deal. This is where hype actually works.
"Biggest event of the season" type stuff. If your investment supports that, then people will
start calling it that.

Make your free thing mysterious and valuable through comparisons. Instead of
saying "if you do x, you’ll get a free t-shirt" we’d say "if you do x, you’ll get something more
than a gift card but less than a Tesla". People will automatically abstract what they’re going
to get towards the bigger thing. Give a range of values between two known items: one low-
value and one high-value. Then say someone, some group, or everyone will get this
prize. This keeps things interesting. Being vague allows people’s imaginations to fill in the
perfect copy for each of them. And you’re not gonna beat anyone’s imagination. So—refuse
to share details. Leave an open loop that only people who take the desired action can close.

BONUS: I practice what I preach. Below you can find photo ads we made of this
winning video ad. And surprise—these were big winners too. Kaleidoscope to the rescue.

[BLANK PAGE]

=== Page 97 ===
Ad Framework #3: The Rumors Are True

Why This Ad Framework Rocks

I position my product as important because other people talk about it. It leverages
curiosity. It results in: 1) someone feeling left out 2) feeling left out of something important.
And these objectives work great to motivate action—which is the point of all good ads...

Good ads do two things: get the prospect’s attention—get the prospect to take action.  So
it would follow that you have a part of the ad that gets attention (importance) and a part
of the ad that increases the benefit and decreases the cost of taking action (other people do
it). This follows the same recipe.

Each added detail keeps "building pressure" with each additional shared statistic/
problem that they probably suffer from. By the end of the ad, the person thinks "man this
guy just named a bunch of stats about my business - and - I’m not at a million dollars a year, he
might be able to help me fix it."

You demonstrate your expertise by how specific or relevant you can describe the problem.
A problem so specific that someone hears it and says "he must be an insider to know this" or
"he must really understand this space" or "I feel like he’s describing my life right now". That’s
what makes ad and like this effective. This is a personal favorite of mine because of how
flexible it is. But remember... BE SPECIFIC.

This pain/problem-based angle is super repeatable in any niche. List all the problems out
as specifically as you possibly can. Continue to build pressure, then resolve the pressure with
a CTA.

Ad Framework #4: You're Being Lied To

Why This Ad Framework Rocks

This ad framework drove a truckload of registrations and book buyers. It’s another spin
on a classic: old way vs. new way. Problem vs. solution. Us vs. them. The classics are classics
for a reason—they work.

The ad likely also worked well because walking around corners and high movement,
especially towards the camera works exceptionally well. This confrontational style paired
well with the hook which was also confrontational.

People for whatever reason have a harder time walking and talking. So, it makes it
somewhat rarer when people do it well. Give it a shot. Ads where I move almost always
outperform. And if you’re wondering why I don’t do that all the time, I’m wondering the
same thing myself.

=== Page 102 ===
Visual Hook:

- Camera movement coming quickly around the corner
- Talent (me) demonstrates urgency
- Cuts quick to large text written on board then a tearoff

Ad Copy:
Hook
You're being lied to...

Meat/Offer
When I started my first business, I was told, if you build it, they will come. That’s not true.
(OLD WAY)
What is true is that if you tell them, they will find you, and you do that only one way,
through advertising. (NEW WAY) And over the last 10 years, I’ve built multiple companies.
I sold my last one for $46 million. (PROOF)
Acquisition.com is now our family office portfolio that does over $10 million a month.
And everyone, and my selfish intent here is that companies go from one million to 10 million
and then hit me up and say, Hey, can you help us go from 10 million to 100 million?
(REASON WHY)

Just so you understand my intention, if you have a business or you wanna start a business
and you don’t believe that if you build it, they will come, or you’ve already experienced the
fact that that’s a lie, then I would encourage you to shift your perspective to “I can force
people to find out”. And we do that through advertising, and that is what I wrote this book
about. (NEW WAY)

CTA
And I’m gonna share all of the things that I’ve learned over the last decade and shrink it into
just a matter of hours for you so you can use it not tomorrow, but today (SPEED) to get
more leads.

=== Page 103 ===
Walk towards the camera aggressively. Tell them they’re being lied to. Confront their
belief. Look into the lens, round a corner, and open with “You’re being lied to”.

Expose the old way and present the new way. Throw rocks at the old way (the lie),
then tell them the new way (the truth). Ex: “I was told if you build it, they will come. That’s
not true. If you tell them, they will find you.”

Show proof your new way works. Use math, authority, social proof, or any other kind
of proof.

Share your selfish reason why. People trust people who share their biases openly, even if
they know the opposing person’s bias is contradictory to their own interest.

Promise fast results. You don’t want to promise fast results per se, but explain how
much time they’re saving—or that you’re compressing for them. Reframe the amount of
time it would take to solve this problem on their own without your product/services—and
frame that as the speed they’re getting.

Tell them what to do next to learn about the new way. Flash large on-screen text that
tears away to reveal a single button and say, “Tap to learn the new way”. One step resolves
the tension you created.

Ad Framework #5: Data Stack

Why This Ad Framework Rocks

This is underrated: Numbers at the beginning of ads, especially big numbers, seem to
work every time I use them. You’ve probably seen this theme at least a few times in this
blackbook. And remember, if you see something multiple times in here, it represents the
absolute best of zillions of ads. So—pay attention.

Beyond that—having half of something written on the board invokes more curiosity
because people want to see it completed. It’s also, in and of itself, a flex to show the work
that went into something. The remaining themes repeat: authority, social proof, curiosity,
scarcity, urgency, call to action.

To make this work, find out, then list out, all the wild stats about your product or service.
Once you have that, there are many permutations of this ad you can create with very little
effort. And when you say a winning thing in multiple ways, it gives you multiple winners.

=== Page 106 ===
Visual Hook:
- Open loop with the numbers half written on the board already

Ad Copy:
Hook
This is gonna blow your mind.

Meat/Offer
67,000 words, 2,000 hours, 270 pages, 107 drawings, 62 pro tips, nine tweets, two years
to make one cookbook for making money (NUMBERS/PROOF). My next book, $100M
Leads, comes out August 19th. I’m gonna be giving away... these and a lot of other stuff live
as just my way of giving back to you guys. (CURIOSITY)

You guys have been amazing. It will be unlike any event that you have been to before. We
already have 200,000 people who’ve registered for the event (SOCIAL PROOF). I have a
limited number of books (SCARCITY)...

CTA
...so if that sounds at all interesting, go there. Register to be one of the first to know and be
there with me live and I’ll see you then.

How To Apply This Framework

Tell them you’re going to blow their mind. Face the camera, point at a half-written
whiteboard, and say, “This will blow your mind."

Collect stats. About your product, project, business, service, etc. Put all of them on one
sheet. Select the most impressive ones. Do this before your recording session.

List your most impressive stats. Rapid-fire numbers: customers, leads, pounds lost,
time saved, etc.—to prove your product real effort for your flagship product or service.

Tell them how many people have shown interest already. All the leads, preorders,
waiting list, group members, etc. that have shown interest. You want people to feel like
they’re gonna be left out.

=== Page 107 ===
Explain the true and real limitations of your product/service. You can’t sell an
unlimited amount (in all likelihood). So, own that you can’t. Think limited hours in a
day, limited number of people you can deliver, limited inventory, etc. Doing this increases
demand by cutting perceived supply. Aka—creating scarcity.

Tell them what to do next. Make it fast, clear, and easy.

PART III: WHAT TO DO NEXT→CHECKLISTS

You’ve now seen the whole machine—how I find winners, how I multiply them, and the
exact steps to do it. Three ideas power the engine.

First, volume negates luck. The process is simple: make lots of ads, spot the few that
perform, pour 80% of your effort into remixing and remaking those, then spend the other
20% hunting for the next winner. One winner is enough to start the flywheel. Permutations
keep it spinning.

Second, winners are rare, so squeeze every drop of blood from them. 80% of sales come
from 20% of ads. When an ad finally clicks, hammer it until it dies—then rerun it with
Kaleidoscope variations. Run new colors, headlines, props, speeds, fonts; swap settings,
talent, and examples. All those small twists cost a fraction of inventing a new winner—
and will give you consistent solid returns. Consistent winners take the volatility out of
advertising.

Third, winning ad frameworks work for any business. The 20 ads you just studied sell
gym services, software, agencies, and a book, yet every hook, proof stack, and CTA can sell
whatever you’ve got. Steal the open-loop selfie, the white-board “four reasons,” the prize
challenge, or the low-number underdog. Swap the details, record, ship, test, repeat. Make
them yours.

PS - My books sit on my desk. I reference them regularly. I share with you the findings I
document for myself. As such, in an attempt to keep my books on your desk—I want to
make it easy for you to find what you’re looking for.

Here are two checklists on the following pages for the next time you make ads. One for
the Ad Kaleidoscope. The other for making banger ads. That way, you can tear them out, or
at the very least, always know where to turn to get what you need.

=== Page 111 ===
Ad Kaleidoscope Checklist

Post-production Apply to an existing winning ad (in order of difficulty)

• New Speed: Ex: Play the entire spot at 1.1x. Just make sure your voice doesn’t sound
weird.

• New Filters: Ex: Add a high-contrast black-and-white filter, or sepia, or social media
style filter, so video looks different than the original.

• New Background/Border: Ex: Swap a white backdrop for a neon-green gradient
border.

• New Fonts/Captions: Ex: Replace the default subtitle font with bold, comic-style
caps for the first three words (or in its entirety).

• New Headline: Ex: Change "Double Your Leads Fast" to "Steal Our 30-Day Leads
Blueprint". Keep the extras.

• New Medium: Ex: Take your hook from one ad, "Would you build your dream
business for $1000? $100? Well how about free?" and turn it into an image.

• New Format: Ex: Re-edit the vertical selfie ad into a square 1:1 version for different
ad placement. Native placements improve performance big time.

• New Meat: Ex: Keep the winning hook, but splice in a different case-study clip for
the body copy.

• New Effects: Ex: Drop a "BOOM" motion-graphic sticker over the revenue figure
as it appears. Or show some visual proof after you say a number-driven hook.

Pre-production Record a fresh version of the same winner

• New Clone: Ex: same gestures, script, background but different clothing, lighting,
etc., so micro-differences feel fresh to viewers.

• New Props Ex: Swap the stack of cash for a silver platter holding signup sheets.

• New Examples Ex: Sexy "$4497/mo Kyle" to "$6398/mo Sarah"

• New Setting Ex: Film the ad on a sidewalk instead of inside the office.

=== Page 112 ===
• New Talent: Ex: Have someone else deliver the script instead of you to attract an
avatar that looks like them. Or even if the person doing the second take is the same
demographic as you, at the very least, it’ll look different.

• New Combination Ex: Shoot the ad on a rooftop (new setting) with a bright red
megaphone (new prop) and overlay comic-book captions (post-production font
change).

Best Ad Framework Checklist

I’m a checklist guy. I divide the checklist into four parts: visual, verbal delivery, script,
and CTA. They correspond roughly to: what they see, what you say, what they get, how
to get it. Within each bucket, I divide them into my own division of “must-haves” and
“nice-to-haves”.

I want to be clear, you can make ads without some of my must-haves... I just don’t. So,
I give to you my real-world checklist for making ads that make money. Enjoy.

SECTION III: MY BEST SKOOL AD FRAMEWORKS

Stack proof by naming progressively larger results, then pivot back to the smallest.
Mention big achiever #1 and big achiever #2 and their outcomes, then circle back to the
underdog customer to show the floor, not just the ceiling. This contrast makes your offer
credible to beginners while still engaging top performers.

Give them a good “reason why” this promotion is a big deal. One of my marketing
rules: They’ll only think it’s a big deal if you tell them it is. So tell them! Prospects will believe
that you’d do something big and crazy if you have a big and crazy reason. Ex: I called
it “the biggest games ever” so prospects felt they’re about to miss something big, not a
routine promotion. Putting your money where your mouth is dissolves skepticism and
adds credibility.

days. (SPEED)

Last month, I think the winner had 40 or $50,000 a month in monthly recurring revenue.
(DREAM OUTCOME + PERCEIVED LIKELIHOOD)

And so this is a hundred thousand dollars prize or more, depending on how much you like
Cybertrucks (DREAM OUTCOME). And we make it pretty easy (EASE). So right now,
one out of two people who start a paid community on Skool make their first dollar online
(PERCEIVED LIKELIHOOD). Oftentimes it's much more, the average is 1,360 bucks per
month in recurring revenue. (DREAM OUTCOME)

Which is kinda sweet. And the reason we have such a high success rate (PERCEIVED
LIKELIHOOD) is because we give you the tools, as in I walk you through step by step
exactly what you have to do (EASE). I also answer questions every single week. Hop on. So if
you wanna hop on there live, I think we have about 200, 300 people hop on the call (EASE).

So it’s, it’s not huge and we’re pretty good at doing it and we’ve now done it with
thousands of people. (PERCEIVED LIKELIHOOD)

How To Apply This Framework:
Give away something insane. Find the stuff your audience likes. Find the most valuable
version you can afford to give away. Then give it away to one or some of them. Ex: a year of
your premium service, a $5,000 store credit, a designer toolkit, even a weekend retreat with
you. Display it on-camera to prove that you have the thing to give away.

Put it on a time constraint. Tie the giveaway to a clear, short window—“in the next
30 days,” “before quarter-end,” “this month only”. A deadline gets more people to do it if
it’s believable.

Prove somebody else has gotten the thing you give away. Reference a recent contest
winner who won the thing. Real-world peers prove the prize is winnable and the process
is legitimate.

Tell them exactly how to get it. Make succeeding their ticket of entry. The simpler to
track (for them and you) the better. Use a single metric that matches your business goal:
most referrals, highest product review count, biggest single purchase, best before-and-after
photo. Note: One clear path beats a complicated points system.

Show how you’ll help them win. Ex: Promise tools, checklists, weekly tips, or live
Q&A so participants know you’ll guide them, not abandon them. If this takes tools or
skills, provide them the best you can. Hand-holding overcomes the “I’ll get stuck” objection
before it forms.

Make something valuable too. Remind them the worst-case scenario is walking away
with all the free stuff (Ex: new skills, discounts, or small bonuses) even if they miss the grand
prize. This makes both outcomes a win, and the only bad outcome not doing it. Make sure
they understand the free thing they get has value on its own outside of the grand prize.

Show proof your free thing works. Cite user counts, testimonial snippets, or quick
screenshots of past wins. Pair visuals with each component to make them dramatically more
compelling—they make a big difference.

Show them what happens the moment they take the next step. Overlay a fast screen
recording or screenshare mock-up of the signup flow so prospects see exactly where the click
leads. Reducing uncertainty about the next step removes the final barrier to conversion.

Section IV: My Best $100M Leads
Book Launch Ad Frameworks
These ad frameworks brought in over 500,000+ people to register for the event in less than a month. That’s more than the city of Baltimore, where I’m from. In other words, these work.

I break the ad frameworks down in the following order:
1) Flying Prop
2) Bribe
3) Rumors Are True
4) You’re Being Lied To
5) Data Stack

Let’s dive in.

Ad Framework #1: Flying Prop
Why This Ad Framework Rocks
We were in my old kitchen filming ads for the launch and the team had the idea to throw a banana at me. At first, they did it as a joke. But then, I took it seriously. And I’m glad we did because it became one of the top ad frameworks for the launch.

Stuff that moves generally beats stuff that doesn’t. And real stuff that moves often beats computer stuff that moves. So, these basically always work. I should probably use them ad is a daisy chain of open loops with only one action to close them—taking the next step.

Daisy-chained open loops: The banana→The money spent on the event→ My birthday→ Giving a secret away.

Everything has the objective to get people to want to come to see what’s going to happen. This accomplishes both campaign objectives of getting someone to register and show. So—it accomplishes the mission.

So if you wanna use these types of ads effectively, capitalize on curiosity.

Ad Framework #2: Bribe
Visual Hook:

• Movement + Prop

You might be wondering why I just mushed the shit outta this banana in my hand.

And it’s because the launch of my second book, $100M Leads, is both nutritious, natural, and uh, will make you lots of money unlike bananas (HUMOR). But the event itself, where I’ll be launching it on Saturday, August 19th, will be bananas.

SECTION IV: MY BEST $100M LEADS BOOK LAUNCH AD FRAMEWORKS

I've spent over a million dollars on the event itself (APPROXIMATION OF VALUE), and I'm going to be giving away a secret thing that I've been working on for over four years to everyone who's there with me live (CURIOSITY). And I would love to tell you what it is. It kills me inside that I cannot tell you. But I want the surprise itself to be worth it, and I think it will be. (CURIOSITY)

This is a date that you're not gonna wanna miss. It's a day after my birthday and it's my way of giving back to you guys for being so awesome. (REASON WHY)

CTA
Click the link to register. I'll see you guys there.

How To Apply This Framework:
Catch a flying prop. Start the video by having the spokesperson catch something mid-air while looking at the camera.

Make a quick joke and tie the prop to your offer. Drop a one-liner that links the prop to your product or service.

Pile on tangible reasons to attend. Mention time invested, money spent, relationship capital used, etc., so viewers see how much you invested to make this great. Tie that investment to what they're gonna get. This approximates their value. In short, make it a big deal to you, so it's a big deal to them. Stakes are a big part of that.

Hint at a big secret and leave the loop open. Tease an unrevealed bonus available only to people who take the next step. Withholding details keeps tension high until they take action. After they take action, you can open more loops to move them through the process.

Props. I'd suggest keeping a shed or a storage closet full of these things. You'd be surprised how often you use them once you start making ads and content regularly. I wish I had done this sooner. Anytime something catches your attention--if you can buy it, do, so--because it'll probably catch someone else's. And when it does, it'll make you more money than it costs (by a lot).


=== Page 92 ===
Ad Framework #2: Bribe

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
This ad framework also crushed. Beyond it crushing though, I included this to show you something important. This hook is the same hook I used for a Skool ad. But wait--one is for an event that sells a book, but the other was to advertise a software platform for building a community?? Aren't those two completely different products and businesses??

Yes. And that's the point.

These ad structures work agnostic of industry. So yes, please model them. Or - don't. But certainly will (and will continue to as long as they work).

Beyond that, you'll notice yet another common theme--curiosity and open loops. Just tons of curiosity and stakes to drive the click. Then, you let the page do its job and convert the traffic.

Visual Hooks
• Me pointing directly at the viewer asking permission to get their attention

Ad Copy:
Hook
Real quick question, what's your email address? The reason I ask is because what I wanna do is send you a gazillion dollars of free stuff...

Meat/Offer
And what that really is, is the biggest entrepreneur event of the season (STAKES). I'm gonna be releasing my $100M Leads book, which is two years in the making (STAKES) live for everyone there with a secret project (STAKES) I've been working on for four years that I haven't said once publicly. I've been saving it. I can't tell you what it is… (STAKES)

CTA
What I can tell you is it's more than a gift card and less than a Tesla and every single person who shows up is gonna get one (CURIOSITY), it's gonna be sick, can't wait to see you there, go register. See you there. (CTA)

How To Apply This Framework:
Tell them what you want. Open with the pattern-interrupt question, "Real quick—what's your [info]?" so viewers instantly know they're trading clear info for something.

Tell them what they'll get in exchange. Promise to send something valuable. Ex: "a gazillion dollars of free stuff," positioning the giveaway as outrageously valuable for anyone in your niche.

Explain why it's valuable. Explain all costs you incurred to create the product, service, etc. (17 prototypes, my entire life savings, cost me my marriage, this obsession consumed my past six years, etc.). If you can't tell someone exactly what something is (to keep curiosity), then you talk more about your investment as a proxy for their potential benefit. If you can talk about other parts directly, then do that.


=== Page 94 ===
"Emphasize that the thing you promote is a big deal. This is where hype actually works. "Biggest event of the season" type stuff. If your investment supports that, then people will start calling it that.

Make your free thing mysterious and valuable through comparisons. Instead of saying "if you do x, you'll get a free t-shirt" we'd say "if you do x, you'll get something more than a gift card but less than a Tesla". People will automatically abstract what they're going to get towards the bigger thing. Give a range of values between two known items: one low-value and one high-value. Then say that someone, some group, or everyone will get this prize. This keeps things interesting. Being vague allows people's imaginations to fill in the perfect copy for each of them. And you're not gonna beat anyone baat anyone's imagination. So—refuse to share details. Leave an open loop that only people who take the desired action can close. BONUS: I practice what I preach. Below you can find photo ads we made of this winning video ad. And surprise—these were big winners too. Kaleidoscope to the rescue.

SECTION IV: MY BEST $100M LEADS BOOK LAUNCH AD FRAMEWORKS

Ad Framework #3: The Rumors Are True

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
I position my product as important because other people talk about it. It leverages curiosity. It results in: 1) someone feeling left out 2) feeling left out of something important. And these objectives work great to motivate action—which is the point of all good ads…

Good ads do two things: get the prospect's attention→get the prospect to take action. So it would follow that you have a part of the ad that gets attention (importance) and - a part of the ad that increases the benefit and decreases the cost of taking action (other people do it). This follows the same recipe.

• The subtitle acts as the visual hook

Why People Struggle To Advertise And How To Fix It
The reason most people struggle to advertise is... they spend too much time making new
ads and not nearly enough time doubling down on the ads that work.
This handbook is separated into three parts. Part I will help you double down on the ads
that work using my Ad Kaleidoscope. Part II will help you find the ads to double down on
with My Best 20 Ad Frameworks Of All Time. Part III will give you checklists to follow for the
next time you make ads.
I start the handbook with Ad Kaleidoscope because if you already have ads, you should
use this immediately to make more money And for those of you who don’t have ads, I’ll give
you my 20 best ad frameworks of all time to make them. In short, if you have winning ads,
use the Ad Kaleidoscope. If you don’t have winning ads, I’ll let you use mine.
And before we dive in, I want to be clear, any business (no matter what industry) can
model the examples in both Ad Kaleidoscope and My Ads Blackbook to advertise better.
Especially yours. So, use them.
Happy hunting,
Alex

SECTION IV: MY BEST $100M LEADS BOOK LAUNCH AD FRAMEWORKS

Ad Framework #4: You're Being Lied To

Why This Ad Framework Rocks
This ad framework drove a truckload of registrations and book buyers. It's another spin
on a classic: old way vs. new way. Problem vs. solution. Us vs. them. The classics are classics
for a reason—they work.
The ad likely also worked well because walking around corners and high movement,
especially towards the camera works exceptionally well. This confrontational style paired
well with the hook which was also confrontational.

People for whatever reason have a harder time walking and talking. So, it makes it
somewhat rarer when people do it well. Give it a shot. Ads where I move almost always
outperform. And if you're wondering why I don't do that all the time, I'm wondering the
same thing myself.

Hook
You're being lied to...

Meat/Offer
When I started my first business, I was told, if you build it, they will come. That's not true.
(OLD WAY)

What is true is that if you tell them, they will find you, and you do that only one way,
through advertising. (NEW WAY) And over the last 10 years, I've built multiple companies.
I sold my last one for $46 million. (PROOF)

Acquisition.com is now our family office portfolio that does over $10 million a month.
everyone, and my selfish intent here is that companies go from one million to 10 million
and then they hit me up and say, Hey, can you help us go from 10 million to 100 million?
(REASON WHY)

Just so you understand my intention, if you have a business or you wanna start a business
and you don't believe that if you build it, they will come, or you've already experienced the
fact that that's a lie, then I would encourage you to shift your perspective to "I can force
people to find out". And we do that through advertising, and that is what I wrote this book
about. (NEW WAY)

CTA
And I'm gonna share all of the things that I've learned over the last decade and shrink it into
just a matter of hours for you so you can use it not tomorrow, but today (SPEED) to get
more leads.

SECTION IV: MY BEST $100M LEADS BOOK LAUNCH AD FRAMEWORKS

How To Apply This Framework
Walk towards the camera aggressively. Tell them they're being lied to. Confront their
belief. Look into the lens, round a corner, and open with "You're being lied to".

Expose the old way and present the new way. Throw rocks at the old way (the lie),
then tell them the new way (the truth). Ex: "I was told if you build it, they will come. That's
not true. If you tell them, they will find you."

Show proof your new way works. Use math, authority, social proof, or any other kind
of proof.

Share your selfish reason why. People trust people who share their biases openly, even if
they know the opposing person's bias is contradictory to their own interest.

Promise fast results. You don't want to promise fast results per se, but explain how
much time they’re saving—or that you’re compressing for them. Reframe the amount of
time it would take to solve this problem on their own without your product/services—and
frame that as the speed they're getting.

Tell them what to do next to learn about the new way. Flash large on-screen text that
tears away to reveal a single button and say, "Tap to learn the new way". One step resolves
the tension you created.
