                                        Raise Prices

        “If you have to have a prayer session before raising the price by a tenth of a cent,
                               then you’ve got a terrible business”
                                         - Warren Buffet

2019.
    Trey was the kind of guy who’d give you the shirt off his back if you needed it. We’re
talking heart of gold, salt of the earth type of person.
    Trey had this dream. He wanted everyone in his little corner of North Carolina to have
access to group fitness and personal training. Noble goal, right? So what did Trey do? He
made his training memberships $49 a month. Insanely cheap.
     And Trey thought the customers coming in at dirt cheap rates would also feel the most
grateful for them. A win win.
    “I don’t think I’m gonna be able to keep my gym open…”
    “Wait, dude. What’s going on?” I asked.
    “I’ve got three massive problems right now, I’m walking on eggshells here”
    “What gives?” I wanted specifics.
     “First, these are the absolute worst customers I’ve ever had. I thought they’d be grateful
for these rates, but it has created a customer service nightmare for me.”
    “Heard, what about the second?”
    “I got more customers, but I still lose money. My savings are gone, and any unexpected
cost would send this whole operation tumbling down.”
    “Geeze… and the last thing?” This looks bad.
    “I can get sign ups at these rates, but I lose so much money each month I have to pay
employees out of what’s left of my savings. I can’t afford to run paid ads. I don’t know what
to do. I’m effed if I do and I’m effed if I don’t.”
    Oh boy. Let’s get to work. “I think you need to increase your prices man”
    “Man, that sounds terrifying. I really don’t want to do that to my members”



                     Copyright © 2025 by ACQUISITION.COM LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION              1
                                            Raise Prices


    “Trey, in 12 more weeks, you won’t have a gym. Which means zero members. It’s do
or die.”
    “Yea…OK fine. What do I do first? I don’t even have enough for rent and payroll”
    “Alright. Employees always come first. So negotiate some partial payments with the
landlord and use that difference to cover payroll. ”
    “Okay. That’ll buy me a couple of weeks. What next?””
    “Alright. We’re gonna create a plan to raise your prices. And we’re gonna get you out of
this. It will feel scary and some people will complain and it will work… OK?”
    “Ok. Deal.” he looked terrified.
    First, we crafted a letter. Then, Trey used the letter as a script for an explainer video that
he posted in his gym community (he turned off comments on the post - and referred all
questions to him directly). The message? Prices were going up. Not just a little, triple. Yes, we
tripled his monthly rates on all his members.
    A week later…
    Trey did lose members. But did he lose all of them? Nope. Not even close.
    The result? Trey’s business went from bleeding $2,000 a month to pocketing $4,000 in
profit. And all this only took a week to roll out. So yeah, it was worth it.

                                                  ***

    This isn’t just about Trey, distressed businesses, or even OK businesses. Although most
business owners wait until disaster strikes before trying to make a bunch of money fast…
you don’t have to. A business doesn’t have to be on the brink of disaster to do stuff that will
skyrocket profits in less than a week. So imagine turning that $4,000 a month into $10,000.
Or $40,000 to $100,000 per month. Or $400,000 to $1,000,000 per month. Aroused yet?
Well, I am.


Outline of This Playbook
    I’m going to walk you through one of the most important profit-building decisions you
can make - raising prices. This can be a death sentence to a business that does it wrong, or
a miracle to one who does it right (like Trey). I’ve made this as concise as I could to make it

as straightforward as possible. So don’t underestimate its potency just because of its length
(ha). We’re gonna cover five things:
    1) Why raising prices is a good idea
    2) Rules of raising prices
    3) How to pick your price
    4) How to raise your price (step by step)
    5) The price raise letter Trey used to get a ton of profit and save his business from cer-
       tain death



Why Raising Prices Is A Good Idea
     When most business owners set prices, look around, see what everyone else is charging,
then charge somewhere in the middle. But most don’t know the big secret...that everyone
else is BROKE. So why copy them?
    On some level, you may realize this, or you wouldn’t be here. Want to know another
secret? The easiest way to make more money is to charge more for the same stuff. Brilliant, I
know. And yet, no one does it.
   People have a lot of difficulty with raising prices. They’re either afraid of getting angry
messages, that their sales will drop, or they simply don’t think they’re worth that amount of
money. It’s ‘poor people’ thinking. And over the long term, it becomes a race to the bottom.
With you and every other poor business owner competing to have the lowest price. Avoid.
    This quote by Dan Kennedy captures the sentiment well: “There’s no strategic advantage
to being the second lowest price in a marketplace. But there is for being the highest.”
    The rich get richer and the great economic divide continues to grow because rich people
understand “the more you charge the more you make.” But it’s not as direct of a link as you
might guess. Smart business owners use that extra money to make more and better adver-
tisements, make constant product improvements, and pamper their customers. They use the
extra money to make it worth the extra money. Everyone wins.
   Let me show you why raising prices creates a virtuous cycle of money making, while
lowering prices - and by extension - entering the race to the bottom - creates a vicious cycle..

                                     Raise Prices




Here’s how the **vicious price cycle** works (which MOST businesses use).

As you DECREASE your prices:
   ʶ   Your clients’ emotional investment DECREASES.
   ʶ   The perceived value of your service DECREASES.
   ʶ   Results DECREASE as a result of decreased investment and perceived value.
   ʶ   Clients INCREASE their demandingness. (Ever notice how the cheapest cus-
       tomers ask for the most?)
   ʶ   Clients get LESS service because you have less money to spend on them


And as you decrease your prices, your BUSINESS:
   ʶ   DECREASES in profit per customer
   ʶ   DECREASES in perceived self-value*
   ʶ   DECREASES its ability to create results for customers
   ʶ   DECREASES your conviction in the sales process, because you and your team
       are no longer sure you can even deliver what you promise
   ʶ   DECREASES your gratitude for customers because you feel underappreciated
       like you’re ‘giving away the farm’

    Here’s how the **virtuous price cycle** works (which is what raising prices does):

    When you INCREASE your prices:
        ʶ   Your clients’ emotional investment INCREASES.
        ʶ   The perceived value of your service INCREASES.
        ʶ   Results INCREASE as a result of increased investment and perceived value.
        ʶ   Your clients DECREASE their demandingness. (Ever notice how the people
            who pay you the most are the most easygoing?)
        ʶ   Your clients get MORE service because you have MORE money to spend on
            them and therefore RAISE your level of service (race to the top).


    And your BUSINESS:
        ʶ   INCREASES in terms of profit per customer.
        ʶ   INCREASES in perceived self-value. (You feel like you are worth more, because
            you charge what you’re worth and are able to serve more.)
        ʶ   INCREASES its ability to create results for customers, because you can get the
            word out and actually help more people by reinvesting money into the business
            and marketing.
        ʶ   INCREASES the level of service you render for each customer.
        ʶ   INCREASES your conviction in the sales process, because you and your team
            are confident that you can deliver what you promise and even guarantee it.
    Hopefully you’re sold on at least considering raising your prices. And before I explain
how to do it, let’s go over a few ground rules that will help you maximize your likelihood of
profit and dramatically decrease your chances of messing it up.


My Rules For Raising Prices
   People are petrified of raising prices because they fear losing some customers. But if they
continue feeding this fear, it leads to losing all their customers because their business goes
under. They wait until the universe forces their hand in a mad scramble to exist. This hap-
pened to Trey. Don’t be like Trey. Uncle Warren said it best:

                     Copyright © 2025 by ACQUISITION.COM LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION           5
                                             Raise Prices


    “If you’ve got the power to raise prices without losing business to a competitor, you’ve got a very
good business. And if you have to have a prayer session before raising the price by a tenth of a cent,
then you’ve got a terrible business.”
    Assuming you don’t have a terrible business and actually do help customers, here are my
rules for raising prices. Internalize these before deciding to raise prices on customers.
    Don’t grandfather existing customers. Don’t do lifetime deals. Value depends on
price. If your value goes up, so should your price. Never lock your customers into a price if
you can avoid it. You never know what you’re going to want to do (or deliver) in the future.
Locking in a price limits your options. Not worth it.
     Never sell a “one time price” for lifetime access. Unless it truly costs you zero dollars
to fulfill. Every business owner I know who started this way ends up fixing it over time. If
you sell “pay me once and I have to deliver forever,” understand that forever lasts a lot longer
than what they paid you once. You typically end up with a bunch of upset customers when
inevitably you run out of the money they paid you but you still have to maintain a com-
mitment. Theoretically, if LTV on lifetime access is greater than what you normally make,
it makes sense. But we don’t live in a theoretical world. Show me one large company with
lifetime access for a one time payment. Right. They don’t exist. Model success not failure.
    It’s good to be insecure in the beginning because you probably suck (for now). But,
as things improve and your brand grows, so should your price. Entrepreneurs often resent
early adopters paying early adoption prices. Don’t be the entrepreneur who hates their cus-
tomers. It’s bad for them and for you. Let your product do its job and have a price to match.
    Raise prices at least once per year. Warren Buffet bought Sees’ candies a gazillion years
ago. And after buying it, he let the managers run the business and control all decisions ex-
cept one - price. He would send them the prices of all products every year. And over 50+
years, he raised the prices on average 10% per year - and in some years up to 17%. If he
made it the sole decision he was in charge of, you can bet it was probably a good investment
of his time. And it probably is for you too.
     Test price raises on new customers before rolling out to your entire customer base.
First, this gives you data to see if it actually makes you more money. Second, knowing other
people have said yes without hesitation will give you confidence when you present it to the
rest of your customer base. It also shows the rest of your base that you’re not making up this
increase in value…the marketplace has already agreed with you.

                                           Raise Prices


    Meet with people if you raise prices more than 50%. If you raise prices *a lot* - which
usually happens when you made a *big* mistake early on - talk to them. But… you do that
on top of all the other stuff I suggest in the next section.
    Fear not. A Shopify competitor discovered they made a grave undercharging mistake.
They charged $30 per month and hundreds of their customers made over $1,000,000 per
year because of their $30 software. Which sounds cool, but they had another problem. The
more sales their customers made the more it cost to fulfill for them. This means their biggest
customers actually lost them the most money! They had two choices. To fire their biggest
customers or raise their prices. So the CEO hopped on the phone with those customers - all
300 of them - and they took their prices from $30 to $3000 on average (a 100x increase!).
Wanna know how many they lost? One. If people see the value, they will stay.
    If you can, pair a price raise within 90 days of a launch. Every business has new prod-
ucts or promotions that launch. The best time to do a price raise is in the same quarter as
a launch. Frame it as early adopter pricing or something similar and it’ll help you draft off
the momentum.
     Do the math. You should know what percentage of customers you can lose and still
make money before raising your prices. And if you’ve already tested the price on new custom-
ers, then no matter what, you’ll make more money eventually.
    Now that we’ve gone over the “rules,” let’s dive into picking the price you’re going to
charge.


How To Pick Your Price
   What’s the best price? Simple: The price that makes you the most money. And that
means understanding how price affects the number of sales you make and the profit you
make per sale. Look at the chart below.

  Price     Clicks     Conv Rate       Sales      Churn         LTV        Total Return   Difference
   $10       100          5%             5         10%          $100           $500            -


   Let’s work our way across. Say we sell something for $10. When we advertise, for every
100 clicks we get to our site, 5% convert. That means we get 5 sales. If this is a recurring
product, then there’s going to be some churn on the subscription. And based on a 10%
churn (1 out of 10 customers cancels the subscription every month, it means we have a
$100 lifetime value per customer. So, in total from “click to close” from 100 clicks to our

                                            Raise Prices


page, we make 5 sales with $100 LTV each, totaling $500. Great. That’s our baseline. That’s
what we start with.
   Then, we decide we’re not making enough money! So, we double it! We go from $10 to
$20. See how the price change affects all the other variables across the columns.

  Price      Clicks     Conv Rate       Sales      Churn         LTV        Total Return   Difference
   $10        100          5%             5         10%          $100           $500            -
   $20        100          4%             4         10%          $200           $800          60%



    When we double the price to $20 (a 100% increase), our conversion rate drops 20%
and our churn remains the same. Meaning, not as many people are willing to pay $20 as
$10. But, more are willing to pay more than aren’t. So instead of converting 5 sales at $10, we
convert 4 sales at $20. And, they stay the same amount of time. This doubles our LTV per
customer. So, we end up making $200 per customer from 4 customers. Those four custom-
ers make us $800 from those same 100 clicks that used to only make us $500 from 5 cus-
tomers. This means choosing to lose one customer to raise the price 100% nets us an extra
60% more revenue. A massive difference. If you owned a business that ran 30% margins with
your first model, you would triple your profit. Hard to imagine anything else that could
make that kind of impact on the bottom line.
   Now, let’s say we get greedy and think “If doubling raised my profits by 80%...10x’ing
my price could raise it by 800%!” Sometimes that’s true. But, not this time. Check it out.

  Price      Clicks     Conv Rate       Sales      Churn         LTV        Total Return   Difference
   $10        100          5%             5         10%          $100           $500            -
   $20        100          4%             4         10%          $200           $800          60%
  $100        100          2%             2         33%          $300            600          20%



     A 10x increase in price (1000%) results in a 60% decrease in conversion. So we go from
selling 5 per 100 to selling 2 per 100. Ouch! And they go from paying us that price for ten
months, to only paying us this ten times higher price for three months. Double ouch! So
customer LTV went up 3x from our original, and 50% from our second price change even
with a 3x increase in churn. But, all in all, the increase in LTV doesn’t make up for the loss
in conversion. So, this still makes more money than the $10 price. But, not as much as our
$20 price.

                                           Raise Prices


    So what’s the best price? We don’t know yet. But we do know the best price of the ones
we have data on - the $20 price point. Next, we’d probably test more prices between $20
and $100. I’d look at $39 - $59. Because if churn stays lowish, these may be even more prof-
itable options.
    Bottom line: The point of this exercise is to demonstrate that pricing affects both con-
version rate and churn rate, which both suffer as prices go up, but not always proportionally.
And that’s the point. You may lose some - but often - not as much as you gain.
   If you can double your price and close 20% fewer deals, with all else staying the same…
you should do it! And that’s exactly what the chart shows with the relationship between the
$10 and $20 price point. So the first and most important thing to do is test, test, test.
   The easiest way to test is to try it out on new customers. Then - provided your churn
doesn’t go up like crazy and your sales don’t go down like crazy - raise it on the rest of
your customers.
     At the end, I’ll share with you two letters. One, a template you can use. Second, the
letter I had Trey send before I knew as much as I do now (it still worked - but we could’ve
made it even better).

                            The Perfect Price Raise Letter

My price raise letters have five sections. I use the acronym RAISE to remember it.
        R - Remind them of the value they’ve gotten.
        A - Address the price change directly.
        I - Invest in their future.
        S - Soften the news with a loyalty discount
        E - Explain away their concerns.
        Let’s dive in.



Section #1 - R: Remind them of the value you provided them already.
    Start by reminding them of all the stuff you do - and the subsequent value they have
gotten from your product or service since they have been a customer. The more you can per-
sonalize, the better. Highlight the number of calls they’ve attended, the number of deliver-
ables they’ve used, the amount of revenue they’ve generated, the increase in profits they’ve
seen, and so on. It might sound something like this:
    “Over the past 12 months, we’ve added so much value to THE PRODUCT THEY USE
        ʶ   We’ve made you X
        ʶ   Feature A helped you do Y
        ʶ   Feature B is great and you use it daily
        ʶ   Etc.”
    Bottom line: Make it about them.


Section #2 - A. Address the price change directly.
     Rip off the bandaid. Don’t waste time. The rest of the letter will soften the blow. It’s usu-
ally a single sentence. It sounds like this.


                         Copyright © 2025 by ACQUISITION.COM LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION          10
                                The Perfect Price Raise Letter


  “For us to continue to invest in making THE PRODUCT THEY USE for you and the
YOUR COMPANY NAME team, we need to increase our prices.”
    Bottom line: Then tell them the news.


Section #3 - I: Invest in their future.
    Frame the price increase in the context of the value you are going to keep providing
them. You don’t want to look like a greedy bast*rd. So now, we show how them paying us
more is going to get them even more of the stuff they love - or didn’t know they wanted. ‘This
is what we’re going to do (and you’re gonna get) with the extra money from increasing your
price.’ It might sound something like this:
    “With these extra resources, we’re going to…
        ʶ   Expand Thing A you love
        ʶ   Hire people to do B and make X better
        ʶ   Invest in making this faster or this new piece of equipment
        ʶ   Making this more secure
        ʶ   Etc”
    You want to make this about investments. Basically just tell them the stuff you already
planned to do in your business over the next 12 months to make it better. And with each
investment say how it will make your product or service more valuable.
    Here are some great investment categories:
        ʶ   Hiring better people
        ʶ   Training the people you have
        ʶ   Better Equipment
        ʶ   Better Technology/Software
        ʶ   Facility Upgrades
        ʶ   Higher level of service




                     Copyright © 2025 by ACQUISITION.COM LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION          11
                                The Perfect Price Raise Letter


    Note: 1) Don’t say things you’re not going to do (that’s lying) 2) Frame all investments
you make as value for them 3) Don’t decide to add expenses you didn’t plan on incurring -
this negates the benefits of the price raise to begin with!
    Once you have your investments nailed down, pair each investment with more good
stuff or less bad stuff.
    More good stuff: more aligned with their desired outcome, faster, easier, risk free.
    Less bad stuff: misaligned with their desired outcome, slower, harder, riskier.
    Example:
        ʶ   Hiring & retaining great people so that we can…build out this feature everyone
            has been asking for OR deliver a higher level of service OR faster response times OR
            extended hours. etc.
        ʶ   Training the people you have so that we can…build out this feature everyone has
            been asking for OR deliver a higher level of service ETC.
        ʶ   Equipment so that you can… use this rather than paying separately OR make better
            stronger widgets (so you get better widgets faster)
        ʶ   Technology/Software to make your experience faster and more accurate
        ʶ   Facility Improvements to elevate your experience
     Bottom Line: Tell them how you’re going to invest the money. Clearly show how that
investment gets them even better bang for their buck. Don’t lie and say things you won’t
do. Don’t incur expenses to justify the price raise negating the extra profit you’d get in the
first place.


Section #4 - S: Soften the news with a loyalty reward.
     People are more ‘okay’ with a vanishing discount than they are a raise in price. And -
they mind even less when another discount appears in the future. So - we raise the price now
and then immediately offer a discount that expires 3 to 6 months from now. Bonus points: if
you can show that they’re getting this credit to their account on their invoices, do it. So now
- it almost feels like we’re gifting them money/credit now, more than we are raising prices. It
might sound something like this:




                     Copyright © 2025 by ACQUISITION.COM LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION            12
                                 The Perfect Price Raise Letter


    “You’ve been insanely loyal to us the past X months/years. As of today we’re raising prices on
new customers, but since you’ve been so loyal we’re going to keep you on your existing plan for the
next (3 to 6 months). So we are giving you a [$XXXX credit] as a way of saying thank you. (after
which we’ll nudge/bump you up to the new price of $XXX).
  Bottom Line: Tell them they are special. New customers have to pay full price today.
Whereas - they (because they’re special) get a discount today and a price raise in the future.


Section #5 - E: Explain away their concerns.
    You want to let them know you take their concerns seriously. And - personally. So, this
is not the time for “it’s not scalable” talk. Get ready to roll your sleeves up and respond to
customers. But, not as many will reply negatively as you think. Why? Because of the PS
statement. And this is crucial. Add in a line that says basically “If this is gonna make you
homeless or end your business, let me know, we’ll figure something out.” I have a B2C and
B2B example below.
     Thank you for letting us be a part of the COMPANY’s mission. If you have any questions at
all, let me know. All replies go directly to me.
   B2C Ex: PS - if this will materially affect your ability to buy groceries, let me know and we’ll
work something out.
   B2B Ex: PS - if this materially impacts your business, let me know and we’ll work
something out.
    You’ll find there are three types of people:
        Type #1: People who see the value. They may not like it. Nor should they. But they
        will understand and comply because they get enough value.
        Type #2: People actually affected. They will write you sob stories. This gives you op-
        tionality. You can respond with something like this: “Don’t worry, we got you. Why
        don’t we extend your discount another 6 months, then reach out then. Is that fair?”
        Type #3: People who were gonna cancel anyways. You will get an increase in churn
        the first month, then a decrease in churn the month after (typically lower than nor-
        mal). Then a return to baseline month three. This indicates a high likelihood that
        you simply “pulled forward” churn. Meaning, people who were going to cancel or
        not buy next month, just decide to do it a month sooner. So you only miss one

        month of revenue from this tiny slice. I talk about this in more detail in the Churn
        Checklist Playbook.
    Bottom Line: Give them a way to voice concerns in the PS statement. Be ready to talk
to a lot of customers one on one. For key customers it actually affects, be ready to extend
the terms of the discount for a longer period or make more smaller jumps rather than fewer
bigger ones.


What This Letter Looks Like All Together
    This sounds like a lot because it took a bit to explain. But, the letters themselves stay
pretty short. So I figured it would be helpful to see what these letters look like.

                          ***Template Price Increase Letter/Email***

    Dear [NAME],
  Over the past 12 months, we’ve added so much value to THE PRODUCT/SERVICE
YOU USE
        ʶ   We’ve made you X
        ʶ   Feature A helped you do Y
        ʶ   Feature B is great and you use it daily
        ʶ   Etc.
  For us to continue to invest in making THE PRODUCT YOU USE for you and the
CUSTOMER’S COMPANY NAME team, we need to increase our prices.
    With these extra resources, we’re going to…
        ʶ   Expand Thing A you love
        ʶ   Hire people to do B and make X better
        ʶ   Invest in making this faster or this new piece of equipment
        ʶ   Etc
    You’ve been insanely loyal to [YOUR COMPANY NAME] though, using us for the
past X months/years. So, as of today we’re raising prices on new customers, but since you’ve

been so loyal we’re going to keep you on your existing plan for the next (PICK: 3 TO 6
MONTHS). So we are giving you a [$XXXX] credit as a way of saying thank you (after
which we’ll bump you up to the new price of $XXX).
    Thank you for letting us be a part of the COMPANY’s mission. If you have any ques-
tions at all, let me know. All replies go directly to me.
    [YOUR NAME]
    PS - if B2C: if this will materially affect your ability to buy groceries, let me know and
we’ll work something out.
    PS - if B2B: if this materially impacts your business, let me know and we’ll work some-
thing out.


What to Do Next
    Actually. Send. This. Don’t be a chicken. Send it. That being said, if you have reserva-
tions because of how big a price raise you need, here are two options I like:
1) You can just go all the way up. If you aren’t profitable and you need to make the move,
   then do it. It worked for Trey. It worked for others. It may work for you.
2) You can do it in one to three increments. You position the discount as a stair step up.
   Some portion of it falls off every X months or quarters. Ex: “We’ll give you $200/mo
   off for the first 4 months, then $100/mo off, then $50/mo off last three months.” This
   allows you to ‘ease’ customers into their new price.
    If you have a community where your members congregate, you’ll want to consider mak-
ing a video like Trey did and posting it in there. If you have the option to turn off com-
ments, do so. You don’t want a b*tch fest in the comments. This is why we refer them to talk
to you directly with the PS statement.


What To Do About Incoming Customers
     To be clear, get new customers up to the new price immediately. No point in delaying
that. They have no context. If they give you flack because they heard it was cheaper from
a friend, your sales team can say “That may feel like bad news but it’s actually good news.
First - it’s good news because we just keep making the value better. And, to give you some


                     Copyright © 2025 by ACQUISITION.COM LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION          15

confidence, 96% of our customers agreed. And they should know - they’re already using it.
Beyond that - the good news is - this is the cheapest it’ll ever be. So there will never be a bet-
ter time to get started.” People moan, but they still buy. Just because someone wants something
for less doesn’t mean they won’t buy it for more.

                        My Gym Price Increase Letter

     My good friend Patrick Campbell from Profitwell oversaw 100 price increases directly,
and analyzed over 500. He collaborated with me on the more concise version I explained
earlier. Candidly, his template and the price increase letter I gave gyms to use cover the same
basic tenets - I just took LONGER to get to the point. I like his better. But for the sake of
completeness I included mine below. This was close to word for word what Trey sent out to
his gym.

                           ***My proven gym price increase letter***

    Dear [Name],
    As you may or may not know, we are going on [years/months] of being open as of
next month.
    As you most likely have seen, we have grown a tremendous amount over this period of
time. A letter with black-and-white words can never communicate how deeply grateful I am
to you for being a part of this journey. You have honored us with your patronage, and I want
to honor you with transparency and with a significant improvement to the level of service
you have been receiving. We want to truly transform lives, not just say we are.
    To live up to this, I wanted to make you aware of the effort we put into this on a contin-
ual basis, and what is coming down the pipeline, which the coaching staff and I are incred-
ibly excited about.
    A few of the upcoming improvements are as follows.
    WHAT WE CURRENTLY DO
     1. Hire and Retain The Best Coaches: We strive to hire trainers who are sharp and have
tremendous work ethic and warm hearts. We strive to replace the traditional model of fit-
ness—watching the clock, counting reps, lack of enthusiasm, lack of knowledge or person-
alization—with a friendly face that knows your name, top-notch coaching, and motivation
to not only get you in the door, but also to keep you coming back.
     2. Offer Continued Education: The best coaches in the industry are the best because
they invest in their education. As a result, we continuously invest in our coaches’ education
like [certifications/workshops]. We train our coaches to provide the absolute best service in
the region so you get the results you are after as fast as possible.


                     Copyright © 2025 by ACQUISITION.COM LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION           17
                               My Gym Price Increase Letter


     3. Provide New Equipment: As we continue to learn about new training systems and
methodologies, we continue to invest in up-to-date equipment. This applies to new equip-
ment like [equipment] we recently purchased, but also replacing malfunctioning equipment
like [equipment]. In the next few months, we also plan on bringing in [new equipment] to
give you even more to look forward to and to help speed up your results.
    WHAT IS COMING
    1. Facility Improvements: We’re a lot like the Millennium Falcon: we ain’t pretty, but
we’ll get you there… fast. While we don’t provide cucumber-scented towels and marble
bathrooms, you deserve working AC and showers. So our goal is to dramatically improve
this facility or move to a new one to improve your training experience and have a gym
whose quality matches the caliber of its members.
    2. Member Events: To further build this community and connect you all with one an-
other, we are planning on hosting events so you have something social to look forward to.
(Don’t worry—you can cheat on your diet every once in a while.) This is so you all can get
to know one another like we know you, which I feel is one of the greatest benefits of owning
this gym.
    3. Specialty Programs: We will also be rolling out specialty programs to those members
who would like more attention and individualized coaching to address specific needs for an
even faster rate of progress than is possible in a large-group setting.
    4. A MASSIVE Improvement to the Level of Service: This is the one we are the most
excited about; it’s also the one I am most petrified about announcing. We are planning on
changing the programming from a «come whenever you can» to «you now have an appoint-
ment with a trainer 3x per week.» This is with the full intention of making the class sizes
smaller so that we can provide you even better service. It will also help with some of the
parking issues that the city has been continuously reaming us for, so you won’t have to fight
for a space anymore.
     Candidly, we never want to be a «get your sweat on» facility. We want to be a gym that
prides itself on transformations (both internal and external). And we have noticed that mak-
ing sessions «whenever you want» has become «never» for many people. And this does not
sit well with me.
    We have also noticed that people seem to get results in the beginning, but then they
tend to slow down as the novelty wears off. You keep working out, which is great, but I want
you to transform with continuous progress.

    As such, we will be implementing accountability on top of our normal service. You will
be checked in ahead of time, and if for some reason you miss your session, we will hound
you and make you feel terrible about it (joking). But we really do want you to be here and
treat it like an appointment with yourself.
   Now, all of these continued investments and upgrades in the level of service we provide
you will require significant funds to become reality.
    And to continue to stay aligned with our mission to provide a remarkable experience
for our clients, we will be implementing a change in billing structure. Instead of «unlimited
come whenever you want,» we will be switching to weekly billing. This switch will be an in-
crease of about $10–$15/week depending on your current membership. But the final result
will be $39/week with an effective date of [MM/DD/YYYY]. (Note: You can also simply
attach a letter or chart on the back if you have multiple levels to show where they will be.
Break it down to weekly.)
    Since we will have these as scheduled sessions, we have a revised calendar, which I have
stapled onto the back of this letter. Please check it out and take a picture of it. We will be fol-
lowing these hours effective [MM/DD/YYYY]. This is partially due to the change in season
and typical member traffic trends from last year.
     For those of you concerned about the $10–$15/week, I want you to know we are si-
multaneously launching a Refer-a-Friend program where you get a full month of service for
every friend you refer who signs up as a client. So refer 12 friends over the next year and get
an entire year absolutely free, as our way of saying thank you for helping us transform more
lives. I’ll be announcing this in video format in the Facebook group as well.
    Now, let’s be super real. Human beings HATE change. But we also understand on some
level that change is a part of growth. What I do NOT want under any circumstances is for a
gossip mill to be started. So my team and I will be happy to address any questions you have
related to the change in person.
    Not via text…or FB Messenger…or Instagram DM…or email…or on a Facebook
thread (God help us all).
    We want to talk IN PERSON. That way, there’s zero chance of miscommunication. So
we will not be allowing any social media group posts related to the «business side» of the
gym. The group will stay focused on what it is intended to be—a forum for the community
to connect and encourage one another on this path to transformation.
   I hope I have your support in allowing us to continue to serve you in the best way we
know how.

    Like I said earlier, I like the shorter template better. But, I hope this also shows you you
don’t need to be perfect. This letter worked just fine for hundreds of gyms.
    Cover the main points. Be bold. You’ll survive. And, if you follow my rules of raising
prices, you will likely profit bigly as a result.

                    Why You Should Actually Do This

     Most business owners live lives of quiet desperation. They keep their heads barely above
water. They try harder and harder every year, and for some reason, they make the same or
less. This is a hard way to live. Oftentimes, it’s because they don’t understand the power of
pricing. And just how much more you make with even small increases in price. That being
said, you have two options. Allow competitors to slowly grind your price down until you
can’t offer any more for any less. Or, take control, and set the prices that maximize your
goals.
    When you optimize pricing the right way, you…
        ʶ   Attract better customers
        ʶ   Make more profit per customer
        ʶ   Invest the extra profit into making a better experience
        ʶ   Invest more into more advertising to grow the business
        ʶ   Unlock more expensive channels of acquisition your mispriced competitors can’t
            use
        ʶ   Feel good about your product/service
        ʶ   Keep the best talent because you can pay them the best
    When you do it wrong (or never change prices at all), you…
        ʶ   Bring in the wrong customers
        ʶ   Watch your profits slowly erode
        ʶ   No longer reinvest in your product or service
        ʶ   Keep less money every month
        ʶ   Feel worse and worse about what you sell
        ʶ   Lose the best talent to competitors who can pay more
    For that reason, you should absolutely revisit your pricing at least annually. First, make
up for inflation. Second, make up the other costs that may have gone up. That being said, I
have included a price raise checklist to make this easy for you. Well…easy to do. Maybe not
so easy to stomach. But, fortune favors the bold. Raise prices one time. See that you don’t
die. Notice how you just make more money. Get addicted to price increases. Keep making

your stuff better so that you can keep raising your prices. And, you’ll be well on your way to
glory and riches (kidding). At the very least, you’ll have a much more profitable business.

    DO YOU WANT TO SCALE YOUR BUSINESS?
    The fastest way to make more money is to charge more money for the same
    thing. Even better, do it without losing any customers. When you do that, you
    give yourself a permanent raise, make your business more valuable, and build
    a war chest of cash to ward off competitors. When you don’t, you eventually
    get beat by inflation and competitors who do. Worse yet, if you do it wrong,
    you can lose customers and money. But - costs go up over time. Raising prices
    is a fact of business. You have to do it. And you want to do
    it right.

                                 Price Raise Checklist

☐ Decide on price increase
☐ Test with new customers first. If they buy and stay at rates that increase how much mon-
  ey you make, continue to the next step.
☐ Segment out ‘old’ customers that came before the price raise.
☐ Write out 1-5 bullets of current value: Get as much data as you can from customers
  to demonstrate what you’ve done for them so far, or how much they use the products/
  services you have. Personalize to the greatest degree possible.
☐ Tell them the price raise happens now
☐ Write out 3 bullets of the biggest investments you’ll make with the profit from the
  price increase. These are the things you’re already going to do.
☐ Explain how these investments benefit them.
☐ Give them an expiring discount as a reward for being a loyal customer. This softens the
  blow.
☐ Tell them you respond personally if they have any issues.
☐ Sign in ink if possible. If not, sign the email personally.
☐ Finish with a strong PS statement telling them to reach out again if this is going to
  ruin their lives or business.
☐ Do this individually if the price raise is 50% or more and you can manage the call vol-
  ume.
☐ Stair step discount: If the price raise is a lot, you can “stair step” - aka - drop off the dis-
  count at 6 month intervals to accomplish 2-3 mini jumps in price. People have an easier
  time handling disappearing discounts rather than raised prices.

    Dear [NAME],
  Over the past 12 months, we’ve added so much value to THE PRODUCT/SERVICE
YOU USE
        ʶ   We’ve made you X
        ʶ   Feature A helped you do Y
        ʶ   Feature B is great and you use it daily
        ʶ   Etc.
  For us to continue to invest in making THE PRODUCT YOU USE for you and the
CUSTOMER’S COMPANY NAME team, we need to increase our prices.



       *** Optional: if you have strong things you can add that clearly benefit them.***

     We plan to invest the extra revenue to make your experience even more valuable in the
following ways:
ʶ   Thing one - more good stuff you like (faster, higher quality, more reliable)
ʶ   Thing two - less bad stuff you hate (slower, lower quality, less reliable)
ʶ   Thing three - more good stuff you like

                                  ***End of optional section***



    You’ve been insanely loyal to [YOUR COMPANY NAME] though, using us for the
past X months/years. So, as of today we’re raising prices on new customers, but since you’ve
been so loyal we’re going to keep you on your existing plan for the next (PICK: 3 TO 6
MONTHS). So we are giving you a [$XXXX] credit as a way of saying thank you (after
which we’ll bump you up to the new price of $XXX).
    Thank you for letting us be a part of the COMPANY’s mission. If you have any ques-
tions at all, let me know. All replies go directly to me.
