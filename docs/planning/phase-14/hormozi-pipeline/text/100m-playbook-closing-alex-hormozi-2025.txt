                           Houw to get them to say yes, after they say no



January 2017,

    I had a rough 90 days. My grandfather died. My mother was in the hospital from
a life-threatening injury. After four years of building and selling my first five gyms, my
business partner drained our accounts and hid the money overseas, and... as the cherry
on top, I got into a head-on collision, landing myselfa DUI and some time to think... in
a jail cell. And the person I least expected came to get me. Leila. Then, my girlfriend of
only six months, already acting like a ride-or-die.

    “You look like $h*t” she said.

    “Thanks.”

    “You ready to work, or what?” Same old Leila.

     “Always, but where?”

    We lived in motels for months trying to get this Gym Launch thing to work. I didn’
even have a place to live. It really did feel like starting from rock bottom.

    “My dad said we could stay at his place until we figured this stuff out,” she said.

    I could only respond by sinking into the passenger seat of an Uber (since I had just
crashed our car). My head hung low.

    “What's up?” she asked. Trying to sound upbeat.

    Everything and nothing. 1 felt grateful for them but disgusted with myself. Ziving with
my girlfviend’s parents? Jesus Christ. Has my life really come to this?
    “Leila,   I've got nothing.   I'm a sinking ship, and I dont think you sho
                                                                               uld go down


with me. I know I wouldn.”
                            loc ked eye s wit h me , an d sai d: “Al ex, I wo ul d sle ep wit h yo u
   She grabbed my chin,
under a bridge if it came to that.”
    I would have cried tears of joy, but exhaustion robbed me of any emotional capacity.
    “Are we still gonna do these launches starting tomorrow?” she asked. “All my friends
quit their jobs to do this.”

        1 was scared. 7his isn't gonna work..

.       One ofthem finally spoke up. “I had a couple of ladies say they needed to talk to their
    husbands.”

        Another said, “I had a few of those, too. A bunch also said they needed to think
    about it.”

        Then another, “Yea... and a lot of people think it’s too expen-" I cut him off.

        “Holy $h*t—you guys can’t handle these? What are you, cashiers?” I was seething.
    “For this to work, you actually have to sell!” I looked off to the side to hide my anger. I
    failed. Zake a deep breath. 1 exhaled and continued, “Look if someone stalls, just ask for
    their main concern and work with it. If someone wants to ask a decision maker, rely on
    past times the decision maker supported them. If someone has a price objection... Look

    if we were selling Ferraris at this price, people would be clawing over each other to give us
    money. You gotta explain the value. You gotta connect life now to what it could be affer
    they buy.”

        A timid hand went up...

        “Yeah, what?” I spat.

        His voice cracked in fear. “Can, uh, you teach us this scuff?”

        None objected—all looking to me for an answer.

        Blood rushed from my face. His question hit me like a bus. The sales guys weren't
    lazy. They weren't dumb. They weren't unmotivated... They didn't know how to sell.

        “Alright boys, this is on me. I should've prepared you better. Let’s spend the rest of
    this huddle going over objections.”

        They agreed.

        “Also, I'll make us a playbook before the next huddle. We'll drill it every day and
    you'll become pros in no time, deal?”

        They looked excited to work. It felt good. T almost forgot my life was in ruins.

                                                    FAok




       Leila walked in. “How we doin?”

.      “Awful, they’re tanking everything.” -

                       Gym Launch wouldn't have become the very large company it is today without
                training my team to overcome sales objections. And my life, well, I think you have an

                idea of what would have happened to me if this sales training didn’t work...

    ‘                  It’s good to let people know about the stuff you sell. But, it only matters if people buy
            .   it. So, even more than advertising, I owe the life I have today to closing the sale. Knowing
                how to close has been the difference between success and massive failure. And despite how
                much money this skill makes... it doesn't take long to learn.

                       Sales teams routinely double close rates with effective closing. I can hardly think of a
                better use of time. How else can you reliably double the close rates of an entire team?

                       Closing is important. And this playbook shows you exactly how I do it.




                Why Is Closing So Important?

|                      Advertising means letting people know about the stuff you sell. Once a person shows
‘               interest in the thing you advertise, selling begins. Closing, the most important part of
                selling, starts afier you've asked the prospect to buy. This means if you don't close, you
}               don’t make money. Making money is important, duh. But there’s way more to the story.
|               Let me make an analogy to drive this point home.
                    If you look at the greatest athletes of all time, they score the points that marter:

            .       In American Football, the top five red zone offenses make the playofts 90% of the
                time. When they get close to the end zone... they close.

advertising itself closed the prospect. You just have to show up to accept payment. Most
businesses only get customers from this bucket. You have
                                                                      to try and mess up that sale.
And trust me, some businesses
                                  do.

    Second, you have your NOs. Aka - Unqualified - Unqualified people are a bad fit
for the product. Like people in Ohio who opt in to a gym offer in Florida. This tends to
happen from confusion about what you sell, results you promise, and how they happen.
In short, the advertising pulled in the wrong person
                                                           .

    Third, and most importantly, you have your MAYBEs. Aka - On the fence - People on
the fence value what you sell but have reservations about exchanging money for it. They
might buy your thing... and might not. Most people interested in what you sell fall into
this bucker. These are the people we train for. And the job of the salesman is to check
those boxes, close the deal, and finish the job that advertising started.

    Closing separates winners from losers because it determines who gets the massive
number of customers from bucket three. Aka - the people who might say yes... if only
somebody closed them.

   And don’t believe any mythology about certain prices or buyers who “would never”
buy something without a salesperson. People buy cars online with their credit cards now.
People have bought and sold property for millions on the internet. It’s not impossible, it’s
just a smaller pool.

     After all, you absolutely can advertise well enough to get someone to buy. It’s just that
if you do that successfully, you typically have a large group of other people you could also
convince to buy by explaining away their concerns and nudging them over the finish line.
This means the better your advertising, the more maybes you get. And, better ads reach
more people. So better ads make the pie bigger, and closing gets you a bigger slice of it.
This is the opportunity.

  Power: The Missing Ingredient In Most Buying Decisions


                                  The money is in the maybes.



    People on the fence struggle over a buying decision. If you think about it, they have
too little power to influence their own decision one way or another—so they waffle. For
 that reason, people on the fence avoid deciding altogether. They think “maybe yes” and
“maybe no” which means neither yes or no. This decision avoidance becomes the sole
focus of closing,

     Decision avoidance leads to profit-destroying confusion among business owners. Let
me explain. See, a purchase describes a black-and-white event. People either buy or not.
 Right? Wrong. I understand “No” and “I avoid deciding” look the same because neither
leads to a purchase. But look to your own experiences as a consumer. Sometimes you feel
sure about your “no”. Other times you're not so sure. In one situation you knew you didnt
want the product. In the other situation you had trouble deciding... so you avoided the
decision. Remember, advertising splits an audience into three major buckets, not two.
People who will buy, people who won’t buy, and people who might buy. This means some
of the people who might buy, don’t. And those people almost always get swept into the
“no” bucket. This horrendous mistake costs businesses so much money it makes me sick.

    You eliminate this profit-destroying problem by answering one question: How can
you tell the difference between somebody who doesn’t want your thing and somebody who
avoids deciding?

    Closing. The answer is closing. Remember—people who struggle with a decision lack
decision-making power. Closing gives people the power to decide. The goal of closing isn't
to get the prospect to buy. Closing gives the prospect enough power to overcome decision
avoidance. To make a decision one way or the other. And you should feel OK about yeses
and nos. Look at it this way. If you close properly then—best case, they buy your thing
and live happily ever after. Worst case, they don't. But you dodge the cancerous and costly
bullet of unqualified purchases. So, giving somebody real decision-making power means
you win either way. And I mean that. But, you should feel bad about letting anyone stay
on the avoidance treadmill. If you let that happen, you let them down. Everyone’s time is
wasted, nobody benefits, and the prospect is worse off. For that reason, you must give
people the power to decide.

                Blame: What Robs People Of Their Power

     Ifa person avoids a decision because they don't have decision-making power... where
does the power go? Follow the finger of blame. People avoid making decisions they could

make (about purchases or otherwise) by blaming stuff that /soks reasonable but, when you
take a closer look, it doesn't make much sense. You know full well that when people avoid
tough decisions, they blame all sorts of goofy stuff. Tough purchasing decisions are no
exception. But it doesn't take a rocket scientist to explain this. If it’s helped them avoid a
tough decision in the past, they will continue doing it in the present. So addressing these
decision-avoidance falsehoods allows people to make a genuine decision for themselves.

   Like we already know, people blame a million and one things on their avoidance.
But in my experience you can put pretty much everything into three categories. Seck
to understand, not memorize this. If you do, you can have effective closing conversations
about almost anything.

      The reason I visualize the onion of blame this way is to teach salespeople to prepare for
 cople to say no move than once. They did nothing wrong. Its expected. People ofien have more
than one thing they blame. And, we need to patiently give them the information to return their
power to them. Be preparedfor people 10 swap objections. And when that happens, it means

     What Blame Looks Like During

         In sales, we call the power-stealing stuffpeople blame “obstacles” or “objections”.
        And let’s be real, no one says “I'm suffering from a distorted reality, please educate
 me”. Instead they say something like “I don't have time right now” or “I need to think
 about it” or “That’s too expensive”. So let me lay out the common objections in a mol
 familiar way:

                   partner doesn't trust me to buy stuff)

              b)   Trust/Skepticism: “I've been burned before” or “Let me think about it” or
                   “What makes you different?” (I don't trust you enough to buy stuff)

     3) Self:

              a)   Fear: “It might work for them, but it won't work for me” or “I'm scared to
                   repeat my past mistakes”

              b) Avoidance: ‘I need to think about it”
                                                     or “Send me a brochure and I'll email
                   you tomorrow”

     With that being said, let’s get to it. I'll provide the words and a visual for each so that
if you give this to your team, you can reference it.



“So Much Stuff, ’'m Overwhelmed!” - Use what feels right to you.
    I want to make a few things clear. Closing is about understanding how blame robs
people oftheir decision-making power. So once this all clicks, and it will, you'll be able to
say this stufifn your own words, on the fly, in no time.
    I've closed many thousands of times, and I've only put closes in here that I've used
with  succ ess. I kno w I give more , but you only need one or two way s to resp ond to cach
obstacle. The point is to get good at closing, not become an encyclopedia of closes. So
commit to learning the ones you like and you'll do just fine, But you must really commit
to learning them.

                               My Rules of Closing

                                         D


                                         O,


                                         N       —




                                          %                     [5)



    I designed this guide explicitly for “after the prospect says no”. As I alluded to in the
beginning, the better you are at marketing, the more concerns have been resolved ahead
of time. The worse your marketing, the more thorough your sales team and process need
to be. It needs to be used in this way. That being said, I have a few things I'd like to pass
on as you start this journey...



    1) When in doubt, repeat back what they said. When you repeat back what they
        said, you get some time to think about what you're gonna say next - and - you get
        some active listening bonus skills. Now, I'm not saying be a parrot, but the reality
        is—too few salesmen listen at all, so this is good practice in general for most.

    2) Acknowledge or agree, but never disagree. The moment you disagree, it increases
        the likelihood people become hostile. Avoid. Instead, buy yourself time by doing
        two things: 1) repeat back the last thing they just said. Nod your head. Then say
        either something like “totally agree” or “totally understand” or “that’s a great point”
        or “thank you for bringing that up” or “You're totally right, I forgot to mention...”
        as ways to transition into your closes. We want our closes and responses to be
        reframes or other ways to think about it—but never a disagreement.

   3) Before getting real, get permission. If you need to “get real” with someone, ask
        them for permission first. Here are my two favorite ways: 1) “Can I be a coach
        instead of a friend for a second?” 2) “Would it be totally overstepping for me to
        put my coach hat on for a second?” 3) “Can [ tell you what I told someone in your
        exact position just yesterday that helped her make this decision?” Then deliver the
        harsh truth.

     9) Volu me neg ate s luc k. The bes t wa y to gua ran tee tha t you 'll be wor ld cla ss is to do
         so many sales that it would be unreasonable that you aren’t.
     10) Don’t assume objections mean they won't buy. More times than you might
         think. Statements like “It’s expensive” aren’t actual objections. Sometimes they're
         just observations. To which you can respond, “T agree.” Or, just let them proéess
         out loud. Unless they say they don’t wanna buy, don’t assume it. Sometimes people
         just process their thoughts out loud. You're just there for the show.

     11 ) Never change your price on the spot to get a sale. Assuming your product
         provides the value then changing the price just to get a sale sends you down a sad,
         dark, and ethically questionable path. Nevermind getting bullied by your own
         customers! Avoid.                                                                           ik

     12 ) If you feel like you're always in a battle, look at what happens before they
         show up to the call and at your scripting before you ask for the sale                                      '

13) Only ask for the sale when you think you've got ‘em. If you think they need
    more convincing, keep probing.


14) People want to believe you. They want to buy. You must help their brains justify
    the decision they already want to make.

15) Selling happens before you ask for the sale. Closing happens after.

16) It’s easier to handle problems before you ask for money than
                                                                             after. Diffuse as
    much as you can before the ask.

17) Expect and plan for no. It's not failure; it’s expected.

18) Price shock isn’t a “no.” Unless someone tells you there’s a problem, assume
    they're just processing their thoughts out loud.

19) Selling properly is the first step to becoming a coach. If you want to help
    people, you need to learn to help them make decisions to help themselves. And
    that’s exactly what a helpful coach does.

20) The person who cares the most about the prospect wins the sale. Keep the
    prospect, not the sale, as the priority. If you keep their long-term well being at the
    center of the conversation, you will approach things with the right frame. They
    will hear it in your tone. It also completely divorces you from needing to make
    a sale. This pays dividends long term. Sometimes the best sales we make are the
    ones we don'.

21) Seek to understand, not to argue. This diffuses any tough situations. Just try and
    understand their perspective rather than get them to agree. Ask questions, don’t
    accuse.



22) Selling is a transference of belief over a bridge of trust. You can only build
    trust if you genuinely want to help. You build trust by doing tips 11, 12, 13. They
    create an environment that increases the likelihood of a sale occurring. And -

23) Belief and trust are a continuum, not binaries. You can always get better at
    getting people to believe and trust you. So the question isn’t whether they believe
    you or not, it’s how much they believe you.

24) Closers ask hard questions because they genuinely care. You wanna be kind,
    not nice. Nice guys don’t want to offend. Kind people want to genuinely help the
    person improve their lives. And sometimes that means calling them on their BS...
    in a tactful way by helping them realize it for themselves.

    These are the 80/20 closes. These are the 20% of closes that work 80% of the time.
After this section, we'll go into specific closes for each source of blame. They work well
if people bring the same obstacle back up. But these puppies cut through a lot of smoke
and mirrors and force prospects to wake up and decide. Or, pick a real obstacle you can
then overcome.

     You can use these to respond to any objection that’s *not yes*.

    The “What's Your Main Concern” Close

    You say: What's your main concern? What are you afraid of happening?

    ‘This is probably my most used phrase to build rapport with a prospect. If someone
says they need to think about it, ask what their main concerns are or what variables they
are using to make the decision. This allows you to have a more productive conversation. If
they give you fluff answers, use the more pointed version, what are you afraid of happening?
If they still don’t budge, spell out the actual worst case... so you're afraid ofspending money
and  me  stea ling it and spe ndi ng it in Vega s? They 'll lau gh and say no, the n you' re bac k in
the sale and they'll give you a closer answer to the truth.

     You say: Right, well because it sounds like it’s nothing to do with the program; its
something else. What are you afraid of happening? Let’s talk about that.
     This works astonishingly well.


     The “Zoom Out” Close

    You say: Let’s zoom out for a second. You want [X]. We sell [X]. Do you think
overanalyzing the details might be the reason you haven't made it happen yer? At the end
of the day, you just need to decide whether you think this makes itatmore  li‘kel. for

    The “1 to 10” Close

    You say: On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 means you're not interested at all and 10
            ;
 means you'e ready to start
                                right now, where do you see
                                                                   yourself?


    If they say 10...

    You say: “Great. Let’s rock and roll.” And close th
                                                               e sale.

    If they say 9 or less...

    You say: “What would it take to get you to a 10
                                                              2"

     They reply
    You say: “No big deal. I think we can take care of that for you. Feeling 10ish now?”




    The “Best Case Worst Case” Close

    Here are three variations.

     1) You say: Let’s consider the options, both are risk-free, only one is guaranteed to
not get you what you want. Best case-worst case. Option one, you do the thing, you get
the resulg, life is awesome. Option two, you don't do the thing, you dont get the result
because you didn’t do the thing. Option three, you do the thing, but then you don't get the
result. These are the options that can happen in front of you because we have a guarantee,
they're all risk-free except for one of them. Only one of them has a true guarantee of not
getting you where you want, which is walking out the door. So, which risk-free option do
you want, the one that’s risk-free that guarantees that you're not going to get there or the
one that’s risk-free and has the potential to get you where you want to go?

    2) You say: Best case we change your life forever. Worst case you get X amount of
time free and learn a bunch of stuff along the way. Either way you get closer to your goal.
Ready to start?

    3) You say (No guarantee alternate): Let’s consider the options. Option one, you
take a risk and do this. You either hit the goal or you get closer to your goal no matter
what because you'll learn a ton. Option two, you take no risk but you guarantee you
don't get what you want—by not starting. So,
                                             which option do you feel gets you closer


to your goal?

    Core Argument: “ avoid buying your thing because of stuff out of my control.”

    What
       To Do About It: We help them understand how they choose to let circumstances
decide for them. But that’s good news, because it also means they have the power to
change it. This shifts decision-making power from the circumstances back to them.

    Saying “I cant make the wedding because (something ousside of my control) came
up” absolves the person of responsibility. They can avoid saying no and get away with it
by blaming other stuff. Our goal is to get them to say “I'm not going to your wedding
because I'm choosing to do something more valuable to me.” You want the prospect to
understand there is absolutely nothing wrong with making genuine decisions in their best
interest.

 What I Say When They Blame Time




               BLAME TUAT)




     Blaming Time. People get busy. Then they get unbusy. Then they get busy again.
                                                                                                           Life
works that way. But here’s the thing—people make time for scuff either way. So if
                                                                                                        anyone
points their finger at “time,” we have two things to address.

     What To Do About It: First, we help them see where their hou
                                                                                            rs go. Second, we
discuss how they can better use them.

     If our thing saves them time compared to what they
                                                                            do now. If our thing makes their
life easier than they have it now. And if we support them so
                                                                                      they get maximum value
from it. Then, compared to the other stuff,
                                                       our thing really does make for o better use
                                                                                                             of
their time. Win-win. And since we're ther
                                                  e to help, starting while busy is actually
                                                                                                       the best
time to start. It means they'll get even mo
                                                re value when they’re no!

When people sa
                    y they don't have
                                         the time, these sound like...

           I'm too busy right now”
         “p,




     *   “Idon’t have the time
                                   ”



     “Better To Start Wh
                            en You're Busy”


     Yo‘f say: Totally understand. Honestly, here’s some good news: the busier you are, the
better time it is to start. Because life is always going to have busy seasons, and if you can’t
figure out how to do it during busy seasons, then this isnt going to last. And you want
this to last, right? Then what better time to do it than when you need it most?

     “You're Gonna Get Busy Again”

     You say: Totally understand. Even if you did wait until it wasn't busy,
                                                                                  youd get busy
again right? Well, then even if you did start when you had time, you'd stop

moment you were busy. So, if you learn how to make this work when you're busy, then

you'll be able to stick with it no matter what life throws at you. And you want this to be
permanent right? Right...

     (Nudge over the edge) And besides, this is geared to give you time back, not cost you
time. The first thing we're gonna do is get you to stop doing all the stuff that isn't working.




     “It’s Not About Timing, It's About Priorities”

    You say: Totally understand it’s a busy time right now. Can I ask you a real question?
What are you doing that’s more important than this right now? ... okay, well, either
youre never going to have time, or something needs to become less important so this
can be more important. It sounds like it's more a question of priorities than it is timing,
Because let’s face it, stuff is always going to come up. So either [goal] is more important
than these interruptions, or it’s not. And if ic’s not, that’s totally okay. I'd racher you leave
knowing you're never going to achieve [goal] rather than suffering all the time hoping it’s
going to happen. It’s either important enough to change your schedule for, or it’s not.
And if it is, then let’s do it.

When people say they don’t have the time, it sounds like...
     o     “Pll start when I have the time”



     The “When/Then” Close

    You say: Totally understand. This is a classic example of a when/then issue. I used to
do this all the time. Can I explain why this thought kept me stuck for almost a decade?
Well, it’s a false premise. When you say “I'll do it when I have more time” ic’s like saying
“When I get healthy, then I'll go to the doctor” or “When I'm rich, then I'll start sa'\'in:'
money.” It flips the order.                                                                                                 °

              ng money. Using money to avoid purchasing decisions comes in four flavors:


       1) Not enough value. They point their blame finger at the price. Here, they have the
            money but avoid buying because they don’t see the value.

                  b)          .
       2)   I can't afford it. In the next (far rarer) situation, they see the value, but it really
            does cost more than they've got.

       3) Other people do it for less. In the next, they point to other people who rhey
.           claim offer a similar product for less.

       4) I’d buy it for less. And finally, you have people who haggle and ask for discounts.



       We'll cover how to overcome all four.

“It’'s Good That It’s A Lot”

    You say: I understand that it feels like a lot of money, and that’s actually why I believe                                          “It’s Not A Lc
this is the right step for you. Most of our biggest success stories started exactly where you

    And honestly, that’s a good thing. The fact that this feels like a big investment means                                        you believe you ¢
you're more likely to take it seriously. Just imagine: if you follow all the steps 1 outlined,                                     what point does

When people say they don’t have the money,
                                                                    these sound like...

     e    “I can’t afford it”

     ¢    “It’s not in my budget”




     “Resourcefulness Not Resources”

     You say: So you don’t have the money? In other words, the resources to start, is that
right? Can I tell you something that blew my mind when I heard it?

     Do you know the difference between a self-made millionaire when they had nothing
and someone who has nothing? Nothing financially. The only difference is that it proves
that if they were successful, it wasn't about the resources they had; its about how resourceful
they were.

    (Optional addition if they look like they don't get it): Phil Knight, in the story of
Nike, was about to lose everything multiple times. He needed a tremendous amount of
money and didn’t have it. His people already worked for free. He went to his vendors and
said, “You need to pay my payroll for me.” He used his resourcefulness, not his resources.

    I'm not saying you shouldnt explain the decision to them, you just need to ask for
their support.

      People who blame others for their decision avoidance can be a pain to deal with. But,
it’s totally doable. I've learned over the years that how you deliver your message matters
as much as the message itself. You can have the perfect script, but unless you've got big
rapport and correct tonality you willflop. They're not the prisoners they make themselves
out to be. So if you can get them to laugh at the silliness of blaming others, and that they
really can make decisions for themselves, you'll get a genuine close. And luckily, we now
have some humorous ways to point it out.

     coaches. There are crazy-ass chicks and crazy-ass dudes. There are also good ones. The
     only thing worse than making a bad investment is letting one bad investment stop you
     from making a good one. Don't let that bad decision burn you twice.




     Other People Conclusion

              Remember, in the best situation you talk to both of them at once. Or they come to
     you with permission-in-hand. But if you don’, this gives you the best tools I've got. It’s
     closed many sales for me. I hope it does for you too.

      Core argument: “I avoid buying your thing because I'm scared of making a mistake.”
      They avoid. The qualified prospects’ avoidance when pointing the finger at themselves
 comes in two basic forms. First, they know you can solve their problem but don’t like how
 your product goes about it. This makes their own preferences about features or details of
 your solution to blame. And second, they get scared around new things, or they've tried
 to solve this problem before and failed. In either case they use their own fear getting a bad
 result as a way to avoid making decisions that can actually get them results.

     What To Do About It: We help them decide by explaining that a past failure should
 never make them miss an opportunity for future success. And really, the biggest mistake
of all is not making a decision. If they avoid making a decision it guarantees they stay the
same—which is 770t where they wanna be!

When They Blame Their Own Preferences




    Blaming Preferences. “I want your results, but I need to get them 72y way.” A prospect
may value the results you offer, but avoid deciding because of what it takes to get them.
Like they would, but only if they could change core parts about the product... and sill
get the offered result. We could just as easily have called this the “T want to have my cake
and eat it too” argument.

    What To Do About It: We explain that doing things their way probably led them to
their current problems. And that this means their preferences actually get in the way of
achieving the result they want. 7hey solve this problem either by sacrificing the result chey
want or the preferences that keep them from getting it... And we help them decide whici’1
is more important to them.



These sound like:                                                                                                                   .

     spending their money and their time on, I can tell you what their future
                                                                                                   is. I'll tell you an
     interesting story. I had somebody who was just like you who was like, *You know what, I
     dont want to do this either.* I told her this story. Can I tell it to you? Yes.

         I was with Leila and we went to Sephora, which is a makeup store.
                                                                                                    [ saw these two
     little girls not older than 13. They were giggly and so excited. A sales clerk helped them
’    out explaining the products to them, “Okay, this is eyeliner, this is lipstick, this blush and
     so on.” The girls were so excited. Then, right before she hands it to them she says, “Girls,
     you have to remember, now that you're getting older and you're becoming women, you
     need to start budgeting for this stuff. You're going to start buying this every month, so
     remember, you've got to save some money for this so you can have it.” So the young girls
     are thinking, “Yes, we're becoming women now, and these are the things that women do.”

        When you have a new identity, you have new priorities. You've had priorities that are
    aligned with your old identity. There’s the you that goes out, the you that drinks, the you
    that does the blah blah blah, spends money on shit you shouldn’t do, spends time on shit
    you shouldn’t be spending time on. There’s the you that you want to be. Right now, we
    can draw the line in the sand and be like, “Do you want to keep walking down the road
    that you have been walking?” If you don't, then you have to step into a new identity. With
    that new identity comes new priorities.

        B2B ALTERNATE: People who want to be rich spend money on themselves. They
    spend money on education. They invest in their skill sets bccuuse‘ they want to align their
    identity with the identity of those who came before them, 'who ve done the things they
Q   want to do. Just like those little girls stepping into that identity, we too must step into the
    identity that we want to be. Does that make sense?

 Or is there something else you're afraid of?



      “You Gotta Change To Change”

      You say: Totally he  ar  you . We 'v e got  an  int ern al mo tt o for   suc ces sfu l cu st om er s. Mi nd
 if I share it with you? (nod) You gotta change to change. What you have been doing has
 been getting you what you've been getting, and you gotta change to change. I remember
 I wou ld  go  thr oug h mea l pla ns wit h  peo ple , and   the yd  be  like , “We ll,   can  we   cha  nge this
 because this is wha t I eat for bre akf ast ?” or  “Ca  n we jus t mak e tha t for bre akf ast ?”  An d I'd
 say, “That breakfast makes you lo      ok  lik e you .” Th at wa  y yo u sp en d yo ur  fir st fo ur hou rs
 of the day. .. mak es you r  ban k acc oun t loo k the way   it look s. The  thi ng is tha t it’s goi ng
 to hurt to  cha nge bec aus e cha nge hur ts. The  que sti on  is whe the r the pai n  of sta yin  g the
 same is greater than the pain of change.                                                                                                        .
     If it is, then lec’ do it. If it’s not, then things may need to get worse before it hurts
enough to get better.

     (Nudge) Listen, we know this works, this way. And if we change the variables, we
change the outcomes. You gotta change to change.



     “Change The Variables—Change The Outcome”

    You say: We TOTALLY could change this thing you don't like, but... then youd
probably also get an outcome you don’t like. So I wouldn't feel ethical offering that to
you. Here’s the main point: we know these variables, in this order, create this outcome.
And if you change the variables, you change the outcome. You want this outcome righe?
Then this is the best way we know how to get you there.

     “The Mechanic Close”

     They ask a very specific question or a questii on that you don't know
                                                                                                         the answer       to      thats0

things that we did; we regret the things we didn’t do, the opportunities that we let pass by.

             Yofl say: I totally get why youd hesitate to make a decision. Mind if I share something
        tha might x?lake you feel better about it? (yes) Great... has anyone walked you through
        how to decide on an X program before? No? Well I can walk you through it right
    '   now so you can know you made the right decision. There are three things that we got
        to understand:

              1)   Do you think this will help you get you closer to your goals? Yes or no? They’re
                   going to say yes.

             2)    Do you have access to the amount of money to get started? Yes or no? 7hey’re going
                   10 say yes. If they say no ask if they know someone who has access (resourcefulness >
                   resources). Because the real world is if I was giving you a Ferrari right now for five
                   thousand dollars, youd find the money. If your landlord needed you to come up
                   with ten thousand dollars because you had back rent and payroll, you'd find the
                   money. So, find the money, let’s do it.

|            3) Do you think I/we can help you do this better than on your own? Yes or no?
                   They're going to say yes.

        “Both Options Are Risk Free”

    You say: Super reasonable. That being said, I've got good news and I've got bad
news. The bad news is—you can’t really make an informed decision until you've actually
tried it. Everything else is guessing. The good news is, you can try it risk free. So, I'm
not even asking you to make a decision right now. I'm just actually asking you to make
an informed decision, which you can only do once you try it. If after 30 days I'm not
what [ said, this product doesn’t do what I told you, I didn’t fulfill my promise, or you
don’t think it’s going to work for you, you let me know, I'll give you the money back. No
questions asked.


       “Decadere”

     You say: Totally understand. Can I share something cool with you that helped me
make a decision a while back? (nod) Do you know where the word decide comes from?
It’s Latin for de-cadere which means to kill off, or cut off. Doing this is a decision. Not
doing this is a decision. So the question is, which future are you cutting off? The one
where you get closer to your goals or the one where you get furcher away?

     *    You improve your Return On Advertising Spend (ROAS) of all campaigns

     *    You get better customers who are more skeptical

     *    You improve cash flow (more Paid In Fulls and fewer payment plans)

     *     Get better customer results because they are fully bought in

     e     Out-execute competitors in the same market as you with the same services

     ¢     Keep closers longer

     o     Get better paid salespeople because they make you more money—everyone wins



When you close the wrong way, you...

     e     Ward off good customers

     e     Pay more for every customer
