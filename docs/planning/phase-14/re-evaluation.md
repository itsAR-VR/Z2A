# Phase 14 Re-evaluation — Hormozi Alignment + Mission Fit

## Why this exists
Phase 14 was intended to translate Hormozi-style offer/pricing principles and our market evidence into decision-complete copy for Phase 13. This re-evaluation checks whether Phase 14 outputs are emphasizing the right levers:
- Hormozi: starving crowd, value equation (likelihood/time/effort), offer stack, anchoring, risk reversal, proof, objections.
- Mission/brand: focused, premium, builder-first; plain language; trust cues; “is this for me?” clarity fast.

## Hormozi alignment scorecard

- Starving crowd / niche specificity: **Strong**
  - Evidence: re-framed as a function-led starving crowd (ops/revops/cs ops/finance ops/procurement) rather than a single vertical, while keeping high-frequency workflow pain front-and-center (aligned with Hormozi “starving crowd” and IBM’s enterprise messaging structure).
- Value equation coverage: **Medium**
  - Evidence: `Hormozi/100M Offers Volume 1...` p62-63 is referenced and mapped; copy needed more explicit dream-outcome specificity and stronger perceived-likelihood boosters.
  - Change: Updated `/businesses` hero/supporting copy and pricing cards to reduce “generic gross profit” phrasing and add concrete pain examples + deliverables.
- Pricing and anchoring: **Strong**
  - Evidence: `Hormozi/$100M Playbook Pricing 2025.pdf` p41 anchoring rule is applied via high-to-low tier order and public ranges.
- Offer stack (bonuses/guarantees/naming): **Medium**
  - Evidence: tiers are named and structured, but Phase 14 originally under-specified “what you get” and “what we need from you” (effort reduction).
  - Change: Tightened tier deliverables and added clarifier language so risk reversal is scoped and credible.
- Proof / perceived likelihood: **Medium**
  - Evidence: we had “proof > theory” as a rule, but the copy spec didn’t force “demo-first” above the fold.
  - Change: added an explicit “proof hook” line and more process proof (deliverables + ownership language).
- Objection handling / closing: **Medium**
  - Evidence: FAQ existed but didn’t explicitly define “managed” or reduce uncertainty about inputs/security.
  - Change: added FAQ items to remove ambiguity and reduce perceived effort.
- Continuity / post-deploy servicing: **Strong**
  - Evidence: the offer is framed as managed deployment + ongoing improvement (aligned with Sahil excerpts + retention/LTV positioning).

## Mission and tone alignment
- Plain language: **Medium**
  - Issue: “AI operators” risks sounding like jargon relative to “Zero-to-Agent”.
  - Change: updated to “AI agents” language in the hero.
- Premium + grounded: **Strong**
  - Phase 14 avoids hype phrases, uses ranges, and keeps scope boundaries explicit.
- 60-second clarity: **Medium**
  - Improvement: add more “what you get” / “first step” clarity early, not later in the page.
  - Change: added “start with Discovery” proof hook and made Discovery deliverables more explicit.

## Net result
Phase 14 is still focusing on the right levers (niche, proof-first delivery, managed post-deploy value, anchored tiers). This pass also reconciled the “for businesses” requirement with Hormozi’s starving-crowd principle by shifting from a single vertical to a **function-led** starving-crowd framing (IBM-style structure; plain-language execution). Two weakest Hormozi levers tightened:
1) **Perceived likelihood** (more process proof and demo-first framing)
2) **Effort/time delay** (clearer deliverables + “start here” path)
