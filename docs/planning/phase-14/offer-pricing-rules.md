# Phase 14b Artifact - Offer and Pricing Decision Rules (`/businesses`)

## Decision rule set (apply verbatim)

## 1) Niche framing (starving crowd first)
- Primary ICP (business-wide, function-led):
  - Operators and functional leaders with repeatable, multi-step work across many tools, where delays and errors are expensive.
- Best-fit functions (use these as the “starving crowd” framing):
  - Operations / Ops leadership
  - Sales Ops / RevOps
  - Customer Support / CS Ops
  - Finance Ops
  - Procurement / Supply chain ops
- Constraint:
  - Do not position as “we can automate anything for any business.”
  - Lead with a small set of high-frequency workflows by function, then expand.
  - Do not lead with startup/product-builder language on `/businesses`.

## 2) Core promise and scope boundary
- Promise:
  - "We implement and manage AI operators inside your existing workflows, then improve them over time."
- Scope boundary:
  - No "set and forget."
  - No claims of autonomous replacement of teams.
  - No promise of universal automation in a fixed timeline.
- Reasoning:
  - Market analysis and Sahil excerpts both show adoption fails post-deployment without ownership/servicing.

## 3) Value equation mapping (copy requirements)

| Value equation lever | Rule for page copy | Required cue |
|---|---|---|
| Dream outcome (increase) | State gross-profit and operational-speed outcomes in plain language. | Use examples: pricing updates, return-claim workflows, reporting. |
| Perceived likelihood (increase) | Show implementation process, deliverables, and who runs it. | Use section-level process bullets and FAQ ownership answers. |
| Time delay (decrease) | Emphasize fast start path via Discovery Workshop and 2-4 week Sprint. | Put Discovery outputs and Sprint duration in tier cards. |
| Effort/sacrifice (decrease) | Emphasize managed service and in-tool deployment. | Add “what we need from you” and keep it lightweight. |

## 3.1) Minimum specificity requirement (avoid generic claims)
- In the first two lines of `/businesses`, include at least one concrete pain category:
  - CRM hygiene/follow-up, support triage/back-office actions, reporting/reconciliations, approvals/quoting.
- Avoid broad claims like “increase gross profit” without a concrete mechanism or example in the same section.

## 4) Pricing architecture and anchor order
- Use three tiers and ranges from `Workshop Market Analysis - Zero to Agent.pdf` p13.
- Display order (top-to-bottom, desktop-left-to-right):
  - `Ongoing AI Partnership` - `$2,000-$5,000/month`
  - `Implementation Sprint` - `$5,000-$15,000` (2-4 weeks)
  - `Discovery Workshop` - `$500-$1,500` (3 hours)
- Why this order:
  - High-to-low ordering provides a reference anchor before the down-sell path.
- Pricing disclosure rule:
  - Keep ranges public.
  - Move exact quote to post-discovery scope.
  - Each card must include what is included and a clear expected timeline.

## 5) Risk reversal and trust
- Public risk-reversal language:
  - `100% refund if you aren't satisfied`
- How to apply without overpromising:
  - Tie refund line to the scoped engagement where it appears (Discovery Workshop), and keep deliverables explicit.
  - Add a one-line clarifier directly below it: `Applies to the Discovery Workshop.`
  - Avoid absolute ROI guarantees.
- Trust cues to keep:
  - "What you get", "How long it takes", "Who owns what after launch."

## 6) Proof mechanics
- Proof hierarchy:
  - Demo of real workflow > abstract explanation > taxonomy.
- Copy and layout rule:
  - Every major section (`#top`, `#what`, `#faq`) must contain at least one concrete operational example.
- Above-the-fold rule:
  - The hero must include a “demo-first” proof hook (Discovery Workshop + live workflow demo).
- Acceptable example set:
  - Marketplace pricing sync
  - Return-claim triage
  - Cross-channel reporting
  - Quote-generation support

## 6.1) Perceived likelihood boosters (required)
- Each tier card must specify:
  - explicit deliverables (“what you get”),
  - explicit ownership (“who owns what after launch”),
  - explicit input burden (“what we need from you”).

## 9) IBM-style enterprise positioning (borrow structure, keep it plain)
- Pillars to emphasize in `/businesses` copy:
  - Works with your existing tools (no rip-and-replace).
  - Guardrails + auditability (predictable, reviewable workflows).
  - Ongoing improvement (managed + measured after launch).

## 7) Language rules
- Keep acronyms to a minimum; expand or remove when possible.
- Prefer short declarative sentences over conceptual framing.
- Banned style for this page:
  - "AI magic", "revolutionize", "10x your org overnight", dense technical stacks without user-facing meaning.
