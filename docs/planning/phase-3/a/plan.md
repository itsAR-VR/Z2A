# Phase 3a — Canonical Offer Brief (Name, Persona, Promises, Guardrails)

## Focus
Reduce `Plans/plan.md` into a single canonical offer brief the site and funnel are built around.

## Inputs
- `Plans/plan.md` (Context Brief + objections + messaging prompts).

## Locked Decisions (from RED TEAM)
| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Brand name | **Zero-to-Agent** |
| Event dates | **Feb 28 - Mar 1, 2026** (Sat/Sun) |
| Currency | **USD** |

## Work
1. **Brand/program naming** — **LOCKED: Zero-to-Agent**
   - Public brand name is "Zero-to-Agent"
   - No rights concerns; proceed with this name
2. **Primary persona selection (Event #1)**
   - Choose exactly one primary persona and define who the event is *not* for.
3. **Promise language**
   - Encode the outcome promise (agent + deployment + evaluation) using "designed to" language.
4. **Guardrails**
   - No hype, no job/income guarantees, premium tone.
5. **Operational facts**
   - Toronto pilot: **Feb 28 - Mar 1, 2026**
   - 2‑day format (~12 hours total), pods of 3–4, no alcohol, hands‑on build blocks.

## Output
- A canonical offer brief (structured outline) with any “TBD” explicitly marked and owner assigned.

## Handoff
Pass the offer brief to Phase 3b for IA + copy.
