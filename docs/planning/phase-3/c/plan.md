# Phase 3c — Design + Motion System Spec (TKS Palette, Refunnel Polish)

## Focus
Define the design tokens and motion system to implement the desired visual/interaction quality.

## Inputs
- Phase 3b IA + copy/asset spec.
- Reference captures in `/tmp/site-analysis/`.

## Work
1. **Design tokens**
   - Colors (TKS palette), radii, borders, shadows, spacing, typography.
2. **Motion rules**
   - Global easing, durations, stagger rules.
   - Reduced-motion behavior.
3. **Per-section animations**
   - Hero intro, marquee, card reveals, timeline/agenda, FAQ accordion.
4. **Performance guardrails**
   - Lazy-load media, cap simultaneous animations.

## Output
- A motion/design spec that can be implemented without new decisions.

## Handoff
Pass to Phase 3d so funnel pages inherit the same system.
