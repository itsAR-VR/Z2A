# Phase 10c Output — UX Critique Report (Impeccable Critique)

## Anti-Patterns Verdict
- **AI-slop detection**: Partial fail.
- Why: high-quality visual system exists, but trust/message sequencing and repeated generic phrases reduce perceived intentionality in conversion moments.

## Overall Impression
The product feels premium and coherent, but conversion friction persists because the clearest trust answers arrive too late and credibility proof density is inconsistent by viewport.

## What’s Working
1. Strong foundational visual system and typography hierarchy.
2. Clear single-page IA with recognizable sections.
3. Technical reliability appears stable in observed sessions.

## Priority Issues

### 1) Status/availability wording ambiguity (mobile-critical)
- What: mixed terms (`Admissions live/open`, `Applications open`).
- Why it matters: immediate trust/confidence drop in first screen.
- Fix: canonical status language everywhere.
- Command: `/impeccable:clarify`

### 2) Mobile menu transition harshness
- What: repeated toggling + explicit user complaint.
- Why it matters: state confidence and perceived polish degrade.
- Fix: smooth motion timings + clearer state feedback.
- Command: `/impeccable:animate`

### 3) Speaker credibility packaging inconsistency (desktop-critical)
- What: uneven bios/proof presentation.
- Why it matters: weakens trust in instructor quality.
- Fix: strict card template and explicit proof affordances.
- Command: `/impeccable:normalize` then `/impeccable:polish`

### 4) FAQ is carrying too much decision burden
- What: repeat toggles on high-friction questions.
- Why it matters: confidence requires excessive interaction.
- Fix: pre-FAQ confidence strip + reordered questions.
- Command: `/impeccable:simplify` and `/impeccable:clarify`

### 5) CTA certainty feedback is insufficient
- What: repeated click behavior around core CTA.
- Why it matters: users are not confident first click worked.
- Fix: immediate visual response (`Redirecting...`, disabled state).
- Command: `/impeccable:harden`

## Minor Observations
- Decorative motion should remain secondary to trust copy in first 10 seconds.
- Trust cues should appear in a tighter cluster near commitment actions.

## Questions to Consider
1. What single sentence should a skeptical first-time visitor remember after 8 seconds?
2. Which trust fact deserves above-the-fold placement instead of living in FAQ?
3. Are we making users click to discover information they need before deciding?
