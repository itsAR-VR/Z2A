# AI X E-Commerce by Human Squared

If you're reading this, you're probably trying to get your team up to speed on AI for ecommerce and creative strategy.

And honestly? Good for you. Because most teams are still fumbling around with basic ChatGPT while their competitors are building sophisticated AI systems that run campaigns while they sleep.

The truth is, we've spent the last 12 months obsessing over this stuff. Working with everyone from scrappy startups to billion-dollar brands like Virgin, Liquid IV, and Unilever. Building AI workflows, training teams, and discovering what actually works versus what just sounds cool on LinkedIn.

**And here's what we've learned: there's a massive gap between knowing AI exists and knowing how to use it to drive real business results.**

Most marketing teams are stuck in one of four places:

- They know they should be using AI but don't know where to start
- They're using basic tools but missing the specialized ones that actually move the needle
- They've got scattered AI knowledge across their team but no cohesive system
- They're overwhelmed by the sheer volume of tools, techniques, and "experts" telling them different things

So we decided to put together everything. And I mean *everything*.

## What you'll find in this resource library:

- 🧠 **40+ Industry Experts Worth Following** - The people whose insights have shaped our AI strategies. From OpenAI executives to DTC legends who've generated millions with AI-powered campaigns. Following these voices alone could save you months of trial and error.

- 🛠 **The Essential AI Tool Stack** - Every platform we use daily, from language models to creative tools to automation platforms. But here's the thing: we tell you what each tool is *actually* good for, not just the marketing fluff.

- 📝 **Prompting Resources That Actually Work** - OpenAI's official guides, our proprietary frameworks used with 8-figure brands, plus interactive tools and specialized techniques. Includes the 20+ research prompts that consistently deliver insights our clients pay thousands for.

- 📧 **The Three AI Newsletters That Matter** - Combined readership of 2.2M+ subscribers. These aren't just news dumps—they're the intelligence sources that keep us ahead of the curve on tool releases and practical applications.

- 🔗 **Live Automation Workflows You Can Use Today** - Not theoretical concepts. These are working tools: competitor research scrapers, multi-model testing interfaces, creative analysis systems we've built and refined over hundreds of campaigns.

- 🎓 **Learning Resources From Beginner to Expert** - Official academies, specialized courses, plus that "holy grail" 2-week AI crash course that's helped thousands get up to speed fast. We've tested them all.

- 📖 **Strategic Implementation Guides** - Future predictions, compliance requirements (those $43,792 FTC fines are real), agent building tutorials, and UGC creation methods that keep you legal and profitable.

**Here's the brutal reality:** Mastering everything in this library will take you 6+ months of dedicated learning. Hundreds of hours of experimentation. Countless frustrating nights trying to get workflows to actually work.
