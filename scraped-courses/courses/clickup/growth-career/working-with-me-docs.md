# Working With Me Docs

Creating a Working with Me Doc is a great way to benefit you and your team. Here are just a few of the reasons!

- **Promote transparency** - clearly outlining your working style, preferences, and expectations prevents miscommunications and helps people understand one another on a deeper level.

- **Encourage efficiency and communication** - when everyone knows how you work best, they can adapt their approach to complement yours, leading to more productive collaborations.

- **Foster respect** - by sharing your boundaries and needs, you are showing respect for others' time and energy, which can in turn foster mutual respect within the team.

- **Develop yourself** - the process of creating this document requires self-reflection and awareness, which can lead to personal growth and improved working relationships.

While all managers are required to create a Working with Me Doc, we highly encourage that everyone in our company make one! Be as open, honest, and detailed as you'd like 💜
