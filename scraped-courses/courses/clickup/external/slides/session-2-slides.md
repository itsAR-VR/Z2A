## Key Concepts

### The 4 Types of Prompts

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Zero-Shot** | Ask AI to perform a task without any examples |
| **One-Shot** | Provide one example before the task |
| **Many-Shot** | Provide multiple examples to guide the AI |
| **Chain of Thought** | Break down reasoning step-by-step |
| **Decision Tree** | Guide AI through branching logic |
| **Reverse Engineer** | Work backwards from desired output |

### Core Elements of a Prompt (from ClickUp Session 2 page)
1. **Identity** - Who the AI should be
2. **Task** - What the AI should do
3. **Context** - Background information
4. **Output** - Expected format/result
