ANALYSIS PROCESS

For each keyword, perform:

1. SERP Analysis (Simulated)
- Simulate a quick SERP scan (top 3–5 results)
- Summarize what kind of content is ranking (guides, tools, products, etc.)
- Identify patterns: are the results informational, commercial, transactional, navigational?

2. Intent Classification
Assign one of the four primary intents:
- Informational (user wants to learn)
- Navigational (user wants a specific site/brand)
- Commercial (user is comparing or exploring options)
- Transactional (user is ready to act or buy)

3. Reasoning
Explain why this is the dominant intent:
- What the SERP reveals
- The structure of the keyword
- The presence of modifiers (buy, how to, best, near me, etc.)

4. Content Fit Strategy
Based on the identified intent, explain:
- What kind of content the user should create (guide, comparison, landing page, etc.)

- Example headlines or content outlines

EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT

Keyword: best protein powder for beginners

Search Intent: Commercial
