- [ ] Owner mentions "need more customers" or "competitors getting ahead"
- [ ] Annual revenue $100K+ with growth ambitions
- [ ] Decision maker available within 1-2 conversations

- [ ] Multiple revision rounds expected in scope
- [ ] Unclear business model or target market

### Local Market Analysis Tools

- **Google My Business Insights:** Search "[business type] near [city]" and analyze first 20 results for website quality
- **Facebook Business Directory:** Filter by industry and location, identify businesses with poor online presence
- **Yelp Business Search:** Target businesses with 50+ reviews but no website listed
- **Chamber of Commerce Directories:** Often contain established businesses with outdated digital presence
- **Local Business Associations:** Industry-specific groups with member directories

### Sizing Your Market Formula

1. Total businesses in target categories: Use Census Bureau County Business Patterns
2. Filter by employee count (5-50 employees optimal)
3. Estimate 30-40% have outdated/no websites
4. Calculate 2-5% conversion rate on cold outreach
5. Project 6-month pipeline: Market size × 0.35 × 0.03 × 6 = opportunity count

Hi [FirstName],

I was looking at local [BusinessType] businesses and noticed [CompanyName]'s website hasn't been updated in a while.

Your competitors are using modern websites to:
→ Capture leads 24/7 with online booking
→ Showcase customer reviews automatically
→ Rank higher on Google with mobile optimization

Quick question: How many potential customers do you think you're losing to competitors with better websites?

I help [BusinessType] businesses get modern, mobile-friendly websites that actually bring in customers. Recent client saw 40% more bookings in first month.

Worth a 10-minute conversation?

Best,
[YourName]

#### Email 2: Social proof + Case Study

**Subject:** How [LocalCompetitor] increased bookings 40% (case study)

Hi [FirstName],

Remember my email about [CompanyName]'s website update?

Here's exactly what happened when [LocalCompetitor] upgraded their site:

✓ 40% more online bookings in month 1
✓ Google ranking jumped from page 3 to page 1
✓ Customer complaints about "hard to contact" dropped to zero
✓ Mobile traffic increased 300%

The old website was costing them 15-20 customers per month.

Your current site has similar issues:
- Not mobile-friendly (60% of searches are mobile)
- No online booking system
- Outdated design hurts credibility

I can fix all this in 45 minutes for $500.
