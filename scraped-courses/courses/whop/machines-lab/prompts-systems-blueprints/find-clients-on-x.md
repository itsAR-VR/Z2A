Your profile needs to convert in 3 seconds. Not impress. Convert.

Make it minimalist, clean, and recognizable.
```

**Banner:** keep it stupid simple — gradient, texture, or blank. Done.

## Day 1: Content That Attracts Buyers

### 3. The "I'm-Ready-to-Buy" Content Framework

Most creators post about random stuff... then wonder why no one buys.

Here's what actually works:

**Value-First DM Sequence:**
```
Prospect: [brief description]
Their recent tweet: [paste]

Create 4-message sequence:
1. Genuine compliment + question

No hard pitch until they show interest.
```
