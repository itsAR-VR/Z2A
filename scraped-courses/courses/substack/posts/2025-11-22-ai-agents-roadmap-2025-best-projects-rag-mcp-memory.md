2. **Advanced AI Agents** — More complex systems with reasoning, planning, and multi-step workflows.

3. **Autonomous Game-Playing Agents** — Agents that play games, learn strategies, and act autonomously.

4. **Multi-Agent Teams** — Coordinated agents with shared memory and role specialization.

5. **Voice AI Agents** — Voice-driven agents that interact in real time.

6. **MCP AI Agents** — Agents powered by the Model Context Protocol for tool and app integrations.

7. **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** — Agents enhanced with search, retrieval, and external knowledge.

8. **LLM Apps with Memory** — Applications that store long-term context and personalize over time.

9. **Chat with X Tutorials** — Practical "chat with your data" integrations for real workflows.

10. **LLM Optimization Tools** — Techniques and tools for reducing cost and improving performance.

11. **LLM Fine-Tuning Tutorials** — Hands-on resources for customizing and improving LLMs.

12. **AI Agent Framework Crash Courses** — Essential crash courses for OpenAI Agents SDK, ADK, LangChain, AutoGen, and more.
