# The Most Recent AI Startup Decks You Should Study Right Now

If you want to understand where AI is actually going, stop reading press releases and start reading pitch decks.

- Decks show what founders believe matters before the outcome is known.
- They reveal how teams explain defensibility when models commoditize fast.
- They show how distribution, data, and product insight are framed when capital is still scarce.

Every company here is building an AI-native business. Some are already well known. Others are still quiet, but heading there.
