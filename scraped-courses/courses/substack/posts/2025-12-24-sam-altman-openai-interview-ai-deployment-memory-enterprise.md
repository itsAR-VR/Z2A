# Sam Altman on Where AI Is Actually Going

Sam Altman rarely gives interviews this revealing.

In a 58-minute conversation with Big Technology Podcast, the OpenAI CEO broke down the company's enterprise push, why most companies waste AI's potential, and what the $1.4 trillion infrastructure bet actually buys.

I extracted the moments that matter for anyone building, investing, or competing in AI.

---

## 1. AI Is Already a Top-Tier Coworker

Altman revealed GDP-Val, OpenAI's internal benchmark measuring AI against human experts across 40+ business tasks.

GPT-5.2 Pro now beats or ties experts 74% of the time. Six months ago, GPT-4o hit 38%.

This applies to everything. Legal analysis, financial modeling, PowerPoint decks, customer support, web apps.

You can hand AI an hour of work and prefer its output 3 out of 4 times.

---

## 2. Memory Matters More Than Raw Intelligence

Everyone obsesses over benchmark scores. Altman thinks memory matters more.

His analogy:

> "You pick a toothpaste once and never switch. One transformative ChatGPT experience creates a permanent user."

Enterprise works the same way. Connect your data, the system learns your company, lock-in happens.

Models are converging. Products diverge. Google has distribution. OpenAI has memory that compounds.

---

## 3. We're Still in the Early Days of AI Memory

Altman called today's memory capabilities the **"GPT-2 era of memory."**

What's coming is much deeper:

- AI that remembers every conversation
- Every document you've worked on
- Every email, preference, and pattern you never explicitly stated

No human assistant can maintain that level of continuity.

He gave a simple example: planning a trip over weeks, across scattered conversations and ideas. A future AI remembers the itinerary, the constraints, the fitness prep, and the context without being reminded.

Perfect recall creates a moat that raw intelligence alone cannot.

---

## 4. Most Companies Are Using About 10% of What's Available

The economic value GPT-5.2 represents versus what the world extracts is massive. Even freezing model development today leaves years of deployment value untapped.

Most people ask GPT-5.2 the same questions they asked GPT-4. Early adopters are 10x more productive. Everyone else barely scratches the surface.

The opportunity lives in deployment, not capability.

---

## 5. The $1.4 Trillion Compute Bet Is About Science

The infrastructure commitment targets unsolved problems, not chatbot requests.

OpenAI built the entire Sora Android app in under a month using unlimited Codex tokens. What normally takes a full team much longer.

Double the compute, double the revenue. There's no shortage of problems that need more intelligence.

---

## 6. Google Is Adding AI. Others Are Rebuilding From Scratch.

Adding AI features to old products makes them incrementally better. Redesigning from scratch creates step-change opportunities.

Google bolts AI into search instead of reimagining it. The pattern repeats everywhere: productivity suites, messaging apps, CRMs.

Mobile apps that ported desktop UIs died. Mobile-first companies won. History is repeating.

---

## 7. Your Inbox Doesn't Survive the Decade

Altman's workflow: tell AI your goals in the morning, let it handle all communication, surface only what needs judgment.

You stop opening Slack 50 times a day. You review a dashboard of decisions, solved problems, exceptions.

AI assistance becomes AI agency in 2-3 years.

---

## 8. OpenAI Is Now an Enterprise Company

Despite public perception, **enterprise growth overtook consumer growth in 2025**.

Everyone thinks OpenAI is a consumer company.

OpenAI now has:

- Over one million enterprise users
- An API business growing faster than ChatGPT

The strategy was always consumer first. Models were not robust enough. Winning consumer makes enterprise easier.

---

## 9. AI-Driven Scientific Discovery Has Already Started

Altman expected AI-assisted discovery to arrive in 2026. It showed up in late 2025.

Mathematicians started posting that GPT-5.2 crossed a threshold. Not sweeping breakthroughs, but meaningful changes in how proofs and research workflows operate.

The rough timeline:

- 2025: small discoveries
- 2026–2027: consistent contributions
- 2030: major breakthroughs

AI for science moved from speculative to investable faster than expected.

---

## 10. AGI Might Have Already Happened

The models are smarter than humans in almost every way. IQ around 147-151. Handling 70%+ of expert tasks.

But they lack continuous learning. Cannot realize gaps, learn overnight, return better.

Altman admits:

> "Lots would say we're at AGI. The term is poorly defined. We're in a fuzzy period where it already happened."

His new milestone: **Superintelligence**. When systems run countries, companies, labs better than any human can.

Stop debating AGI. Build for models that already beat experts 70%+ of the time.

---

## Conclusion

Taken together, Altman's comments point to a simple shift. Model improvements are expected now. The real differentiation comes from how well systems remember context, fit into workflows, and take responsibility for outcomes.

Consumer products build familiarity, but enterprise deployments create durable revenue. Infrastructure is a long-term bet because demand for intelligence keeps growing. And the biggest wins come from redesigning work around agents, rather than bolting AI onto old tools.

Most teams are still chasing better models, even though the larger opportunity sits in deployment. There's a wide gap between what AI can do and how much of that capability is actually being used. Closing that gap is where the value lives, whether you're building a company, investing, or running an organization.
