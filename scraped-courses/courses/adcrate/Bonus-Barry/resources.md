> Realistic vertical (tilted horizontal) amateur iPhone .5x ultra wide selfie of a smart 30 year old nurse in scrubs with Brazilian and Scandinavian heritage, featuring fair slightly freckled skin, wavy redish blonde hair, and big light blue-green eyes. She has soft, delicate features and she is concerned and caring. She's holding a red-stained sheet in her hand. Washed out natural overcast light with no shadows and low contrast, capturing a candid, amateur, unfiltered feel. She's in a middle-class brooklyn apartment bathroom and she incredulously says in a thick "Stop ruining your bedsheets with leaky tampons. It's crazy that most women still deal with this stuff and have no idea about menstrual cups. If that's you, click now." NO TEXT CAPTIONS OVERLAY

### Dr Mansplain Prompt

> Realistic vertical (tilted horizontal) iPhone .5x wide selfie of a smart 40 year old man with Dominican and Japanese heritage, featuring tan skin, wavy brown hair, and big light blue-green eyes, he is wearing purple scrubs. He has strong, masculine features and a caring facial expression. Harsh overhead canned lighting with strong shadows and contrast, capturing a candid, unfiltered feel. He's sitting on the bed in a upper-middle-class Brooklyn apartment bedroom and he says in a caring, concerned, but slightly incredulous way "Stop ruining your bedsheets with leaky tampons. It's crazy that most women still deal with this stuff and have no idea about menstrual cups. If that's you, click now to learn more." NO TEXT CAPTIONS OVERLAY

*Note: About 40% of the time you get actual vertical videos that just need to be rotated and then are pretty much good to go.*
