## Prompt Structure

### Prompt 1:

A chaotic handheld medium-wide shot set in the backyard of a Florida college house during an unhinged midday BBQ.

The camera pushes through the madness and lands on a very cute Latina college reporter in her early 20s, standing just feet from a large kiddie pool where a frat bro is riding on the back of a full-sized alligator. She's in a tight crop top and ripped jean shorts, holding a microphone with both hands now—shouting at the top of her lungs just to be heard. Everyone is cheering and shouting.

Her hair's getting sprayed with beer, the mic is slightly tilted from someone bumping into her, and she practically has to scream into the lens:

"WE'RE IN FLORIDA ASKING PEOPLE WHAT THEY PUT THEIR MONEY ON!!"

Behind her, just barely out of focus, a shirtless college guy in a backward snapback and cowboy hat rides on top of the alligator as it thrashes violently in the kiddie pool. He's hooting like a rodeo champ, yelling loudly as he rides the alligator.

Surrounding them, college girls in crop tops shriek with laughter, screaming, cheering phones out, beers in hand—one sprays a can directly upward like a victory fountain. The reporter flinches mid-sentence but doesn't break, riding the chaos with a wild grin.

**Technical Details:**
- Time of Day: High noon, full sun beaming down
- Camera Type: Handheld cinema cam, jostling from all the movement
- Shot Type: Medium-wide, reporter close to frame, action exploding around and behind her
- Focus: Sharp on reporter, gator action slightly motion-blurred in background
- Lighting: Harsh, natural, sun-baked—glinting off chains, cans, and sweat
- Environment: A Florida backyard completely overrun—ripped-up grass, spilled beer, party trash, inflatable pool
- Atmosphere: Deranged spring break energy meets backyard rodeo—a full-blown Florida fever dream
- Audio (implied): Alligator hissing, girls screaming, people cheering, beer cans cracking, and the reporter screaming her line over the chaos

### Alt Prompt 2:

A handheld medium-wide shot, filmed like raw street footage on a crowded Miami strip at night. An old white man in his late 60s struts confidently down the sidewalk, surrounded by tourists and clubgoers. He's grinning from ear to ear, his belly proudly sticking out from a cropped T-shirt. He wears extremely short neon green shorts, white tube socks, beat-up sneakers, and a massive foam cowboy hat with sequins on it. His leathery tan skin glows under the neon lights.

In one hand, he clutches a tiny, trembling chihuahua to his chest like a prized accessory.

As he walks, he turns slightly toward the camera, still mid-strut, and shouts with full confidence and joy:

"Indiana got that dog in 'em!"

Trailing just behind him are two elderly women in full 1980s gear—both wearing bedazzled workout leotards, chunky sneakers, and giant plastic sunglasses. Their hair is still in curlers under clear plastic shower caps. One sips from a giant novelty margarita glass, the other waves at passing cars.

Around them, the strip is buzzing—people filming with phones, scooters zipping by, music thumping from nearby balconies. Neon signs flicker above, casting electric color across the scene. The crowd parts around the trio, half amazed, half confused.

**Technical Details:**
- Time of Day: Night
- Camera Type: Handheld, loose and reactive street-style motion
- Shot Type: Medium-wide shot, tracking alongside the group
- Focus: Sharp on the man and dog, slight blur on the passing crowd
- Lighting: Harsh, colorful neon signage mixed with ambient streetlights and flashing phone cameras
- Environment: Miami nightlife strip, crowded sidewalks, flashing lights, chaotic foot traffic
- Atmosphere: Unfiltered Florida madness, proud and unapologetically weird
- Audio (implied): Crowd chatter, phones clicking, scooters buzzing past
