## Assignment

**Do the Impact vs. Effort Matrix Exercise**

Use the Miro template we shared in the session to:

- Brainstorm 20–30 problems inside your org (especially creative bottlenecks)
- Rate each by impact and build effort
- Pick 1–2 "slam dunk" workflows to prototype (low effort, high value)
